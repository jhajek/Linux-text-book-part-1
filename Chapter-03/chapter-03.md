![*Must be a Linux User...*](images/Chapter-Header/Chapter-03/surgery.png  "Understanding the Technology and Philosophy of Unix/Linux")

### Objectives

  * Understand and know how to complete the Linux and BSD Operating System Install Process for the major distributions
  * Be able to compare and contrast the two major Linux Distribution family's install process with the BSD install process
  * Understand the term *distribution* and *distro*
  * Understand the standard installation formats, full ISOs, minimal install ISOs, and Net-Installer ISOs and the different
  * Understand how to use industry standard virtualization platforms for installing distributions

### Outcomes

  At the end of this chapter you will understand how to complete multiple installations of all the major Linux and BSD platforms.  You will be comfortable using the industry standard virtualization platform to enable rapid install of these operating systems.  You will also be familiar with and be able to differentiate between processor architectures available.

## Installation of a Linux Distribution

The by product of opensource or free software is that the actual code is also free.  This is where the idea that opensource or free software cannot charge money or is related to the public domain.  You can download almost all of the major Linux and BSD operating systems at no cost.  This makes the barrier to entry in using a Linux distro very small, almost nothing compared to using Windows. As noted in the early days of Linux, installation was not very user friendly, but in those interceding 21 years the various distros have perfected packaging and installation has become very simple and extremely user friendly.  Later in this chapter we will install various distributions as part of the lab assignment.

How would one install a Linux distro on a computer?  THe first thing you need is an *ISO*. An [ISO (*"eye-so"*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660 "ISO 9600 standard") file is actually a standard file type that represents the contents of a CD/DVD-ROM in a single archived file format, like a zip file.  Think of ISOs as carrying mechanisms for the content of a disk based installer.  The reason the ISO term and format are tied to the Linux Distro installation process is a historical one.  During the mid 90s Linux rose to prominence at the same time CD-ROM technology began to become affordable and became the method of data distribution that replaced floppy and Zip disks amongst PCs.  It made sense to create distributions that were almost the exact size of a CD-ROM because it made distributing and copying very easy Linux very easy. In this way Linux spread rapidly.

ISO files can be burned or written to various types of media.  CD-ROMs. DVD-ROMs, and more recently USB drives and SD Cards. As of August 2016 you would be hard pressed to find an optical drive on a laptop, 2-in-1s, or even a desktop PC. Though many older and still usable PCs have optical drives.  One of the best tools I have found for creating bootable install media on USB drives or SD Cards is [etcher.io](https://etcher.io/ "Ethcer").

![*Etcher init screen*](images/Chapter-03/etcher/etcher-io.png "Etcher")

### Importance of ISOs

This tools takes away the difficulty out of making install media and with two clicks makes it happen.  It even includes an option to manually just-in-time download whichever ISO you are looking for and "burn" it to the media of your choice.  You may hear the term *"burn"* used in relation to ISOs, all this means is to transfer or write data from one source to its extracted final source.

While you can burn ISO files to media for installation on a desktop or laptop, ISO files also have utility for installing a Linux distribution into a virtualization Platform.

## Virtual Machines

Every operating system is made up of multiple components as we mentioned in chapter 2.  These components are separated by privilege rings. These rings are for privilege separation and are built in security for the operating system. With the higher numbered rings being the least privileged. Traditionally user applications are in ring 4 (sometimes called ["*userland*" or *"user space"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space "user space") and the kernel which has the most power is in ring 0.  For instance a program a user writes cannot just talk directly to the video card and write to the video memory for the screen.  The program needs to go through the OS which in turn goes through the kernel allowing or enforcing commands to be executed.  How then does virtualization fit in? Virtualization or called a [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor "Hypervisor") is a new ring that inserts itself between the OS and the kernel to intercept commands and is called ring -1.

### One Ring to Rule Them All...Operating System Rings

![*Operating System Rings*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Priv_rings.svg/500px-Priv_rings.svg.png "One Ring")

Virtualization works because your x86 (AMD and Intel) enable it at the CPU[^19].  "To do this AMD and Intel introduced extensions to assist virtualization, [VT-x and AMD-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_.28VT-x.29 "x86 virtualization") (called Pacifica). Both instruction sets added nine new machine code instructions that only work at "Ring -1," intended to be used by the hypervisor" [Andy Dorman - Informationweek.](http://web.archive.org/web/20130530214041/http://www.informationweek.com/intel-vt-vs-amd-pacifica/172302134 "x86 extensions")   When dealing with virtualization you are functionally running multiple operating systems at one time.  Technically this is not possible as only one operating system can have control of your hardware at a time - so how does a hypervisor make this work?  

### Virtualization Diagram   

![*Virtualization Diagram*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Hyper-V.png/640px-Hyper-V.png "Virtulization Diagram")

By having the hypervisor intercepting system calls from the virtualized operating system this allows for multiple operating systems to co-exist on one computer unaware of each other[^20].  The way a hypervisor works is not unlike having a professional translator at a business meeting translating between two attendees.  The hypervisor essentially creates two classes of operating systems.  The "*host*" and potentially multiple "*guests*".  The *"guest"* operating system thinks it has complete control of the hardware - but the virtualization software is only showing the guest system a small portion of all the total RAM, CPU, and disk space available.  The hypervisor offers a *"virtualized kernel and drivers"* to the guest operating system.  In turn, the hypervisor translates the system commands to the kernel it has received and translates them to the host operating systems commands.  

For example if we were running an Ubuntu 14.04.5 Desktop virtualized guest system on a Windows 10 host, the Linux desktop has no way of knowing how to issue a command to use the network card to request a website because Linux knows its own OS and kernel and Windows is a completely different kernel and operating system.  The virtualization layer will do the translation for you -- allowing the *"host"* system to think that your guest virtualized operating system is nothing more than a native application, and allowing your guest virtualized operating system to think that it owns the entire set of hardware.  

The main concept of virtualization you need to know is that your computer (PC, laptop, Mac) has vastly more power then is needed most of the time. The benefit of virtualization is that a hypervisor can act as a translator for multiple operating systems running simultaneously on one system.  Thereby maximizing the usage of your resources and preventing you from needing 4 or 5 different physical PCs.  See Chapter 14-15 for application and development uses of Virtualization.   

## Hypervisors

![*Server and Desktop Virtualization*](images/Chapter-03/Hypervisor/Hyperviseur.png "Server and Desktop Virtualization")

### TYPE II Hypervisor - Hosted or Desktop Virtualization

There are basically two types of virtualization.  We will be dealing with TYPE II[^21] exclusively to help us in our mastery of Linux. This type assumes you are using an underlying operating systems such as Windows, Mac, or a Linux distro.  In this case the host operating system handles all of the resource management and task scheduling plus you have the added overhead of sharing the hardware with the installed host operating system.  In addition you can have multiple hypervisors installed but only one can be active at a time.  In general it is best to install only one hypervisor though there are some small edits/hacks that can be done to get [Hyper-V and VirtualBox to run together](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SwitchEasilyBetweenVirtualBoxAndHyperVWithABCDEditBootEntryInWindows81.aspx "Hyper-V and VirtualBox") on Windows. There are four major desktop platforms for virtualization:

#### Microsoft Hyper-V

Hyper-V was originally only a server class product released on Windows Server 2008 R2.  Microsoft ported the technology to be able to be used in Windows 8 and 10 Professional and Enterprise editions for free.  It comes as a add on service component and is a fully functional implementation of the sever class product.  It has the added benefit of being able to work over a wireless connection geared towards desktops.  Hyper-V is a good product, if you have an [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Software_and_services "Xbox One"), you are using Hyper-V to enable backward compatibility for your games. Hyper-V runs on Windows 8 and 10 and runs Windows, Linux, and BSD virtual machines.

#### Oracle VirtualBox

This product was originally an opensource project that was purchased by Sun and then inherited by Oracle. Though the name is on the project, Oracle has been surprisingly hands off of this project.  Because of that it has grown in usage, features, and utility to become the defacto desktop virtualization tool.  It can run on Mac, Windows, and Linux and allows for seamless transfer of virtual machines across platforms

#### VMware Workstation

VMware also released a desktop product that is similar to VirtualBox on Windows and Linux called VMware Workstation. This software predated VirtualBox by nearly 5 years with a separate desktop product available for the Mac called VMware Fusion.

#### Parallels Desktop for Mac

Until 2013 Parallels Desktop was a direct competitor to VMware Workstation on the desktop of Windows and Linux. As of 2013 those products were discontinued in favor of Parallels focusing their desktop product on the Mac.  

### TYPE I Hypervisor - Bare Metal or Native Virtualization

TYPE I is used in server environments on hardware utilizing multiple core CPUs, multiple terabytes of RAM, and multiple terabytes of hard drive space.  A TYPE I hypervisor includes a kernel and tiny purpose driven mini-operating system tuned just for managing and interfacing with virtual machines.  The kernel itself is the hypervisor also tuned with all unnecessary features removed.  This book will not cover TYPE II hypervisors or commercial implementations of them.

   *  [VMware ESXi](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/ "vSphere")

## Installations and ISOs

Now that we covered a bit about what a hypervisor is, let us begin the install process using VirtualBox.  The next pages are going to show you in comparison how to install the latest versions of Fedora and Ubuntu (as of August 31st 2017) Fedora 26 and Ubuntu Desktop 17.04.  This will require you to download two ISOs from their respective download sites. For this install process we will assume that you are using VirtualBox version 5.1.x or later branch.   It might be a good exercise if you have an old laptop or PC laying around to make some installable media (CR-ROM or Flash drive via UNetbootin) and install one of these distributions directly as the primary operating system.  Finding old laptops is easier than you might think. Try asking your relatives (especially around back-to-school and Christmas), a company you work for, or even a school you go to what they have in the way of unused laptops. Laptops/desktops can have a second life and can still be useful to experiment with Linux installations even if the hardware is not the latest or greatest.  Another option to consider is dual-booting or triple-booting your system, we will not cover that option here.  If you do try it, back up your data first, you never know what could go wrong. I created a [quad-boot system](https://forge.sat.iit.edu/2015/05/quad-boot-your-pc-ubuntu-15-04-centos-6-6-fedora-21-windows-10/ "Quad Boot") containing Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos, and Windows 10 see article here for how to accomplish this task.  This processes is beyond the scope of this book but the link is provided for those interested.

You also need to be aware of the type of architecture you are installing to.  Is the processor 32-bit or 64-bit?  If it is a 64-bit processor you can install 32-bit operating system but not the other way around.  32-bit processors are usually only low end older Atom processors and older Intel chips - pre Core 2 Duo processors.  You can find information about your processor by going to [http://ark.intel.com](http://ark.intel.com] "ARK"). This is Intel's clearing house for all its information about processors and motherboards.  They can tell you all you want to know about a processor.  All but the most specialized or low end chip these days is 64-bit you should be safe with that type of distro.  

The 32-bit distro is most commonly referred to as the x86 or 586, 686 architecture.  The 64-bit architecture is usually referred to as x64, but sometimes *x86_64*, and even *AMD_64*, that is not a reference to AMD processors - just a credit in the name as AMD was the first company to implement 64-bit extensions to the 32-bit x86 instruction set--hence the credit.  There is one other type of architecture called ARM or AARCH, AARCH64.  This is the ARM architecture that runs phones, tablets, and small embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi.  It has an entirely different instruction set so the software compiled for this architecture is not compatible with the Intel x86-x64 architecture.  

Each distro also has a checksum feature provided by the site that issues the download.  A checksum is a one way mathematical function that gives you a unique representation of what the content of the ISO should be.  That way if you download and ISO from somewhere and the checksum is different then you might be alerted to someone trying to add additional contents to an ISO or perhaps just a corrupted download.  Most distros use a simple md5 hash, but a few, notably Fedora, has moved to more robust hashes using the SHA-256 hash.

### Planning Your Install

Before beginning there are a series of questions you should ask yourself, "What do I need in this distro?"

  *  Strict Security?
  *  Ease of use?
  *  Stable release with long term support?
  *  Will this be a desktop install or server install?  GUI or no GUI?
  *  What software will you be needing?
    + Serving web pages?
    + Building Android applications?
    + Hacking your neighbor's wi-fi?
    + Developer platform?
    + Server edition (no gui)
    + Cloud edition
  *  What processor do I have, 32-bit or 64-bit?  How much RAM do I have or need?
  *  Is this an old PC or laptop I am using--does it lack processor extensions that can aid in rendering multi-media efficiently?
    + [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions "SSE")
    + [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions "AVX")
  *  Licensing for business?
    + Does it need to be GPL compliant?
    + Can proprietary programs and codecs be included?

### Create Your First Guest Virtual Machine

Upon completion of a fresh install and launching of VirtualBox you should see this image:

![*VirtualBox fresh install*](images/Chapter-03/virtulabox-fresh-install-550.png "Fresh VirtualBox install")

See the [getting started manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html "Getting started manual") for a wide range of information.  Unlike some opensource projects this documentation is actually very thorough and useful.  VirtualBox has a list of [supported host operating systems](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#hostossupport "Supported Host Operating System"), which is basically any operating system you can think of from DOS to Haiku to FreeBSD.

Let us walk through the initial installation process.  The first step to begin is with the *NEW* button.  The next step is where we give our guest virtual machine a name.  VirtualBox has long had support that if you type the type of the operating system in the system name - VirtualBox will auto detect the instance type and version.  If you see the sample below I typed "Ubuntu-17-04-Desktop" and "Fedora-26-workstation." As you type in the title that has the name in it VirtualBox will auto-detect and switch the type and version automatically.  

![*Create New Ubuntu Instance Dialog*](images/Chapter-03//VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-name-and-operating-system-ubuntu.png "Create New Instance Dialog")

![*Create New Fedora Instance Dialog*](images/Chapter-03/VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-name-and-operating-system-fedora.png "Create New Instance Dialog")

What happens if you choose the wrong type or version?  Two things, __first__ if you chose the wrong edition of Linux most things will work but the virtualization layer will not be optimized, try to avoid it.  You can always go back into the *SETTINGS* menu option and change it after the virtual machine is powered off.  __Second__ If you select the wrong version, (32-bit instead of 64-bit) you will receive an error from the BIOS as the operating system loads explaining that it cannot continue.

Next is the amount of memory available - note that this memory is shared with your underlying OS as described with TYPE II hypervisors. Whatever you allocate to this guest VM will be unavailable to the underlying host OS while the guest VM is powered on. Note the slider, each system to install VirtualBox on will have a different slider based on the amount of memory you can allocate.  The recommended amount of memory is at least one gigabyte but more likely two gigabytes will be better.  You can also *"over-provision"* memory by making multiple virtual machines whose memory totals beyond your system's memory by not having them running all at once.

![*Memory Selection Dialog*](images/Chapter-03/VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-memory-size.png "Memory Selection Dialog")

The next step is to select the amount of virtual hard drive allocation.  Here you have a choice of how much hard drive space you will allocate to the guest VM.  This space will be treated as a file by the underlying host OS--allowing for easy migration, export, and even cloning of the guest VM.  

![*Hard disk Allocation*](images/Chapter-03/VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-file-location-and-size.png "Harddisk allocation")

Next is the hard drive file format.  There are a few competing standards.  If you know you are going to be working in the VirtualBox environment then the default VDI type is sufficient.  If you know you will be transferring this Virtual Machine to another environment: VMware (VMDK), Microsoft Hyper-V (VHD), KVM (QCOW,QCOW2, RAW) then you can choose the appropriate type.

![*Drive Type*](images/Chapter-03/VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-hard-disk-file-type.png "Drive Type")

You can chose to dynamically allocate your hard drive space or statically allocate it.  The advantage of dynamically allocating is that not all the space will be assigned right away.  The hard drive will grow incrementally as you need space until it hits the maximum you defined.  The disadvantage of this is that if you are creating lots of data there will be an overhead processing in continually allocating space.  Statically allocating the hard drive space on the other hand will potentially lessen the number of systems that can go on your hard drive because potentially much space that is allocated is actually unused. Virtual hard drives for the guest OSes are treated as files from the point host OSes.

![*Disk Type*](images/Chapter-03/VirtualBox-Install/virtualbox-storage-on-physical-disk.png "Disk Type")

The final option dialog is where you can choose where to store your virtual machine's virtual hard drive. Usually the default is fine unless you know you need to store the hard drive on a separate partition or disk.   Also VirtualBox will make a suggestion on a recommended virtual hard drive size.   

Now click *finish* and you should be ready to go.  

### Walk Through the Settings

![*Virtual Machine Settings*](images/Chapter-03/settings.png "Virtual Machine Settings")

Before we hit the start button - lets select one of our virtual machines and take a look at the content of the SETTINGS button.  Here we will find all the settings possible related to our virtual machine.  Though not entirely correct - you could think of this similar to a BIOS settings on a PC - and area where we can configure any underlying hardware.  The most common options you will deal with are described as follows:

General

: Setting that handle meta-data about the virtual machine

System

: Settings to change amount of RAM and processors - enabling or disabling chipset drivers and CPU features

Display

: Settings to change how the display settings work

Storage

: Settings related to disk drives.

Network

: Settings related to changing or adding new network interfaces or network types.

### Installing Ubuntu

Hitting the *START* button on your virtual machine install for Ubuntu 15.04 Desktop will bring you to a *WELCOME* screen.  Here you will be presented with the option to choose your install language.  As well as presented with two options:  *TRY UBUNTU* or *INSTALL UBUNTU*.  The option *TRY UBUNTU* will load the actual Ubuntu operating system but load it into RAM and not install it on your hard drive.  This is helpful because it gives you the option to use Ubuntu fully without permanently installing it.  Note that all data is stored in memory so nothing will survive a reboot - but this may be a good tool for doing online banking with.  The Live option also has the option to go into an install mode via a desktop icon.

![*Live or Install Mode*](images/Chapter-03/ubuntu-install/live-install-450.png "Live Install")

Under the *INSTALL* option Ubuntu will present you with multiple option tests that need to be passed before install.  Things such as enough available hard drive space, is your computer plugged into a power source, and do you have an internet connection?  In addition you will be prompted if you want to install proprietary codecs automatically during install?  

![*Preparing to Install*](images/Chapter-03/ubuntu-install/preparing-to-install-450.png "Preparing to Install")

This would include things such as Adobe Flash, codecs to playback MP3, and potentially proprietary AMD or NVIDEA graphics drivers.  Your choice and these can always be added later on demand.  The final option is to install updates while downloading - this will add time to the install but also save you from having to launch the update script upon first login.

For installation type you will be presented with default options such as *ERASE DISK AND INSTALL UBUNTU*.  In addition there are options for enabling full disk encryption for securing your install data.  The third option listed is to install using the LVM method of partitioning, which will be covered in chapter 12.  The fourth option is for a custom partitioning, which is helpful in cases when you are installing multiple operating systems and create a multi-boot system.  

![*Installation Type*](images/Chapter-03/ubuntu-install/installation-type-450.png "Installation Type")

At the completion of this dialog box you will be asked to confirm the automatically generated partitions created by the system.  A Linux system needs a minimum of 2 partitions to function but 3 are recommended.  Those partitions are / (pronounced root), /boot (where all the files needed to start the OS are located, and swap (which is an on disk based RAM supplement partition.  

![*Confirm Partitions*](images/Chapter-03/ubuntu-install/write-changes-to-the-disk-450.png "Confirm Partitions")

The next parts of the installation contain pretty straight-forward parts: time zone selection, keyboard layout, and account creation and password setup.  Note that Ubuntu doesn't create any root user by default, which ever user you create first is automatically placed into the ```sudo group``` -- which is similar to a super user.  For a discussion of password strength and strategies [see this cartoon](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png "Password Strength Argument"). You can also see the install details by clicking the small white triangle to reveal the verbose output of the process.  

![*Install Details*](images/Chapter-03/ubuntu-install/installing-system-tab.png "Install Details")

### Installing Fedora

Similarly on Fedora 26 you will be presented with the option to *Start Fedora Live* or go into troubleshooting mode.  You will be presented with an install screen similar above: *TRY FEDORA* or *INSTALL TO HARD DRIVE*. Fedora 26 will initially present you with a language screen option.  After choosing your default language the next step is the *installation summary*.

![*Installation Summary*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/installation-summary-800-by-200.png "Installation Summary")

You will note 4 categories: keyboard, time and date, network and hostname, and installation destination.  The first three options should all be filled out by default, the last option installation destination will have an orange notification icon next to it.  This means we need to double click on this section and enter a sub-menu before we can continue.  

![*Device Selection*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/device-selection-370-by-200.png "Device Selection")

This warning icon is a forcing mechanism to make you review these settings.  You will see visual icons of all the hard disks available for installation.  The one with a white checkmark is the disk where the __"/"__ (root) partition will be installed. If the default selections are satisfactory then you can click __DONE__ button at the top to the screen and continue.   Otherwise at the bottom of the screen are the detailed installation options, which include encryption, LVM, and external installation drives such as over iSCSI or NFS.

![*Specialized Details*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/specialized-disks-330-by-200.png "Specialized Details")

Now you can click "*begin installation*".

![*Begin Installation*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/begin-installation.png "Being Installation")

While the disk partitioner is running and the install process is beginning.  The next screen will prompt you to create a __root__ user password and also to create a non-root user account.  In the Unix/Linux world the __root__ user is akin to the administrator account in Windows, meaning you have all the power to do anything you want to the system.  So use __root__ account sparingly.  You notice a fundamental difference, Ubuntu will not even give you a __root__ account, they make you elevate your privileges, called __sudo__ each time.  Fedora *trusts* you and will give you the __root__ user, trusting you not to destroy the system.   In this case you need to give yourself a strong __root__  password and it is good practice to create a local non-root user account.  

![*User Accounts*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/user-settings-630-by-100.png "User Accounts")

Under the create user dialog box, you will notice a key check box that is circled in red below: *Make this user administrator*.  This allows your user account to be able to use the *sudo* command to elevate up to root user privileges.  This is considered far safer than using the __root__ user continually.  

![*Create User With Sudo*](images/Chapter-03/fedora-install/create-user-with-sudo-390-by-200.png "Create User With Sudo")

You can click the *Finish Install* button to complete the install.  You will be presented with a final *Quit* button which will exit the installer and drop you back into the *Live* desktop.  In order to reboot the system you need to open the system menu via the downwards facing white triangle in the upper right hand corner. The reboot icon is located under the traditional power icon.  Once restarted congratulations you have successfully installed and can begin using your installed Fedora 26 system.  

### VirtualBox Extensions

You may have noticed that when a guest VM is successfully installed the screen resolution may be very small and the mouse integration features are not working. By default VirtualBox doesn't know what your host systems underlying hardware is.  So it guesses by providing a lowest common denominator set of hardware drivers, usually for pretty old, but well known set of hardware.  In order to install higher quality drivers to enable more features VirtualBox provides something called *"guest additions"* to enable exclusive features that are not normally available in an operating system.  These features include things such as shared folders, cut and paste support, and even support for multiple monitors and higher resolutions.     

VirtualBox guest additions can be installed by selecting an installed virtual machine and selecting the menu item under __DEVICES__ then select the "Insert Guest Additions CD Image."  For Windows and Mac as the guest VM OS this is a pretty straight forward install - the attached Guest Additions ISO appears within the VM and you simply double click it and run through the menu, reboot, and new features are added. For Linux you need to compile these extensions into the kernel and some extra tools are needed.

#### Ubuntu

This goes for any distro that derives from Debian.  You will need to install the following from the commandline to assist with the compiling and installation of VirtualBox drivers.  Apt is the Debian/Ubuntu package manager, we will learn about more in depth in [chapter 10](Package Installation). These instructions assume you are using VirtualBox 5.x, *you will need* to adjust the version numbers and path name if you are using a different version.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
cd /media/$USER/VBOXGUESTADDITIONS_5.0.2_102096/
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
sudo reboot
```
#### Red Hat

 On Fedora 26 using dnf

```bash
sudo dnf update kernel*
sudo reboot
sudo mkdir /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
sudo mount -r /dev/cdrom /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel kernel-headers dkms make bzip2 perl
cd /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
# 32-bit and 64-bit systems run following
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
sudo reboot
```

On Centos, RHEL, and older Fedora distros using yum

```bash
sudo yum update kernel*
sudo reboot
sudo yum install gcc kernel-devel kernel-headers dkms make bzip2 perl
sudo mkdir /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
sudo mount -r /dev/cdrom /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
cd /media/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions
# 32-bit and 64-bit systems run following
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
sudo reboot
```

 If successful you can reboot the Linux guest VM and you will notice the changes take place immediately.  If some of these commands are not familiar that is ok - we will cover them all in later chapters. Without these additional tools installed you will receive an error message similar to this:

```
Building the main Guest Additions Module[Failed]
```
