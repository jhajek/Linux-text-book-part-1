## Outcomes

At the conclusion of this chapter you will be able to add additional virtual disks to any Linux version installed in VirtualBox. You will be able to format devices and create filesystems on newly formatted devices. You will understand how to partition a device and install filesystems. This chapter will give you experience with the tools needed to perform these actions. We will study the LVM -- Linux Volume Manager and its new concept for dealing with disks. Finally we will learn the concept of mounting and unmounting of disks.

## Storage Types

In looking at the prices of disk based storage from the Fall of 2015, a single terabyte Western Digital Blue hard drive was selling for ~$50. In the time since, the price of storage has only decreased. Storage is cheap and with that in mind, adding *storage* or *capacity* to a system is trivial. The types of storage available since 2015 have changed drastically.

### Mechanical Hard Drives and SATA Connectors

The original, cheapest, and densest storage type in dollars per megabit is still a mechanical hard drive. Often referred to as an HDD[^135] or magnetic drive.

![*Hard Drive[^ch11f146]*](images/Chapter-11/hdd/427px-Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg "Hard Drive Internals")

These are made up of spinning platters where bits are stored via magnetic charge.  These systems have down sides in that parts of the surface wear out over time as well as they have mechanical parts (servos) that can fail over time. They require constant amounts of power and if you scale this over large data centers, these costs can quickly add up. In addition as the size of storage density has increased, the need to develop new storage mediums has arisen. 

What was once a single magnetic platter, became three parallel platters, then became five spinning platters, which then became glass platters, which then became vertical electron based storage (somehow they got electrons to stand up instead of lay flat...), then moving to [helium filled 10 TB disks](https://www.anandtech.com/show/9955/seagate-unveils-10-tb-heliumfilled-hard-disk-drive "Seagate 10TB helium filled disks") and as of 2022, [Western Digital 26 TB disks](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/data-center-drives/ultrastar-dc-hc670-hdd?sku=ultrastar-dc-hc670-26-tb "webpage WD 25 TB disks").

#### Speed of Mechanical Harddrives Using SATA

These harddrives used SATA Connecters to the motherboard and the SATA protocol to send and receive data. The SATA protocol had limitations of how fast data could be transferred.

  SATA Version              Throughput
---------------------  -----------------------
  SATA revision 3.2      16 Gbit/s 1.97 GB/s
  SATA revision 3.0      6 Gbit/s  600 MB/s
  SATA revision 2.0      3 Gbit/s  300 MB/s
  SATA revision 1.0      1.5 Gbit/s 150 MB/s

#### Transfer Speed and Latency Problems

As disks became bigger a new problem occured called `latency`. This is the amount of time it takes to fully write or read data from a disk. One of the first tricks to solve the latency issue was [NCQ](https://sata-io.org/developers/sata-ecosystem/native-command-queuing "Native Command Queueing"). Native Command Queueing looks at disk requests on the drive and reorders them to reduce round trips that a disk needs to make. The other solution was to add on-disk cache memory of 16-64mb for caching frequently accessed data. All of this is happening at 5400, 7200, 10K, and 15K rpms, revolutions per minute, at a fly-height of 8 Pico meters! But the mechanical harddrive could only gather data so fast.

### Solid State Drives SSDs

In early 2012, a new medium called Solid State Drives, or SSDs, was released. These drives were different than mechanical disks because they relied on Flash Memory (SLC or MLC) and had disk based controllers to address this data. The immediate advantage was that electrons move at the speed of light so the access time of any single bit was identical, compared to a mechanical drive which had to rotate into position to read the correct bits. This increased speeds dramatically and while the original SSDs storage was low and comparatively today the dollar per megabit ration is not as good as a HDD, the read-based access time was orders of magnitude faster.

![*Standard SSD connector[^134]*](images/Chapter-11/ssd/256px-Super_Talent_2.5in_SATA_SSD_SAM64GM25S.jpg "Standard SSD connector")

### SSDs over NVMe

The SSD medium using the SATA protocol had reached its limit. A new trasnfer protocol was needed. [NVMe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express "Wikipedia Article for NVMe") is the lastest incarnation of SSD disk based technology, which stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. 

![*M.2 NVMe SSD Drive[^ch11f145]*](images/Chapter-11/ssd/640px-Samsung_980_PRO_PCIe_4.0_NVMe_SSD_1TB-top_PNrÂ°0915.jpg "Samsung NVMe SSD Drive")

These are solid state drives, but instead of sending data over the SATA interface, they connect directly to the high-speed PCIe bus, just like your video card does. The advantage is in using the PCIe bus[^136] you gain the ability to transmit in 1 to 16x parallel transfer lanes as opposed to a serial fashion which SATA was designed for. NVMe comes in expansion card factor and in the smaller [M.2 form factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2 "M.2 form factor")[^137].

#### The RAM Future That Wouldn't be

Intel had an idea that the future of disk was something of a hybrid between ram and solid state/flash memory. Intel launched a trademarked platform called [Optane](https://www.howtogeek.com/317294/what-is-intel-optane-memory/ "Intel Optane"). The target is cloud based servers running OS Containers and Virtualized platforms. The idea is to increase the speed of disk to the point that is is close to or equal in speed to RAM (Non-volitile memory), thereby eliminating potential memory bottlenecks. Optane was a technology that was before its time, as Intel [shutdown the Optane division in 2021](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3604093/intel-quietly-kills-its-face-melting-optane-desktop-ssds.html "webpage Intel Optane closure article").

### Network Harddrives

With the advent of fast and reliable network we can have our disks separated from our compute. Note that NFS and iSCSI are local network protocols -- they won't work over the internet but will on a local network location (your home office and university for instance).

### Network File System - NFS

> *NFS, the network filesystem, is probably the most prominent network services using RPC. It allows to access files on remote hosts in exactly the same way as a user would access any local files. This is made possible by a mixture of kernel functionality on the client side (that uses the remote file system) and an NFS server on the server side (that provides the file data). This file access is completely transparent to the client, and works across a variety of server and host architectures. NFS offers a number of advantages[^157]:*

* Data accessed by users can be kept on a central host, with clients mounting this directory at boot time. For example, you can keep all user accounts on one host, and have all hosts on your network mount /home from that host. 
* Data consuming large amounts of disk space may be kept on a single host.

### iSCSI

The [iSCSI protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI "iSCSI") is a reimplemntation of the SCSI disk communication protocol. SCSI was an alternative that could move data faster than the then ATA (pre-SATA) standard. Once SATA became available the SCSI based hardware was more expensive and was replaced by cheaper SATA and more standardized USB (for external devices). The SCSI bus was faster than the standardized ATA bus, but required a specialized adapter card and specialized cable to connect devices and external peripherals.  Think of it pre-USB (circa 1998). This made SCSI desirable but expensive. The SCSI standard continued to improve throughput but at the cost of not being backwards compatabile with older and other versions of SCSI, each had its own cabes and connectors. 

By the year 2000 the SCSI protocol was well known and heavily invested in for server class hardware. In that year IBM and Cisco standardized the iSCSI protocol. iSCSI integrated SCSI commands to external targets over Ethernet/IP. Allowing you to separate your storage from compute and access storage over a local network via the iSCSI protocol. Disks were formatted as LVMs or directly as a ZFS, Btrfs, or XFS based drives and then presented as __iSCSI targets__ over the network. iSCSI has two components, the __iSCSI target__ and the __iSCSi initiator__. The system that connects to a target in an __initiator__. iSCSI devices can replace the need for SAN technology (Storage Area Networks) and work on commodity hardware over basic ethernet cables and switches.

This allows you to separate your storage and your compute. You can even use iSCSI disks as your main hard drive and configure this during install time on most major Linux distros. All modern Operating Systems come with support for being either a target or an initiator. A company called [iXsystems](https://www.ixsystems.com/ "iXsystems") has made a business out of providing ZFS based iSCSI storage devices running FreeBSD.

### Virtual Hard Drives and VirtIO

When dealing with Virtual Machines, we can attach and detach storage very easily.  With large deployments of VMware, and Cloud based services, in-place disk can be reformatted and used to attach virtual disks to a virtual machine - with the added ability to manipulate these hard drives as if they were simple files. This [interface was standardized](https://lwn.net/Articles/239238/ "virtuio announcement webpage") and opensourced as part of the `virtio` package.

What is Virtio? "*Essentially, itâs an interface that allows a virtual machine to use its hostâs devices via minimized virtual devices called VirtIO devices[^ch11f147]."* In VirtualBox you can replace the default SATA devices and use the VirtIO interface directly to your disk devices--saving virtualization overhead.

### Disk Management in VirtualBox and Parallels

For this chapter we will assume that you are using VirtualBox 7.x or Parallels 19. The concepts demonstrated should be applicable to any Type II hypervisor. This also assumes you have free space on your computer. Since the point of this lab is to explore and not production usage, you may want to get an external USB hard drive and use that for this chapter so as not to fill up your hard drive.


With your Ubuntu or Fedora virtual machine powered down, let's add some new disks (virtually) to your Linux system. The first thing to do is locate the *SETTINGS* button on the VirtualBox main menu.

![*VirtualBox settings panel*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/settings.png "Settings")

The next menu to come up will show the *SETTINGS* options and the name of the virtual machine you are working on.

![*VirtualBox settings menu*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/settings-menu.png "Settings Menu")

\newpage

Select the *STORAGE* option from the menu on the left--this is where you can attach, detach, and modify virtual disks in VirtualBox. In most cases these will be hard drives, but there is the ability to attach ISO images to a virtual cd-rom device as well. That option is in the top half where you see *Controller: IDE*. Under that you might see the term *EMPTY* or you might see a virtualbox-guest-additions.iso attached.

![*Storage menu*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/storage.png "Storage")

We will be working with attaching virtual hard drives so we are interested in the bottom portion of the menu which is identified by *Controller: SATA* which is your [Serial ATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA "Serial ATA") hard drive bus connection.  As a refresher, Serial ATA is the name of the signaling protocol the operating system uses to retrieve data from a hard drive. Go ahead and highlight the SATA Controller entry.

In order to add a new hard drive to your virtual machine, click the blue HDD icon with a __+__ sign at the bottom of the menu.

![*Add Storage Icon*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/add-storage-icon.png "Storage Icon")

Upon completion of that step a new menu will pop out of the HDD icon and give you and option to *Add Hard Disk*.

![*Add Storage*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/add-storage.png "Add Storage")

\newpage

Once you have selected *Add Hard Disk* a familiar set of screens come up, these are the same screens you walked through in chapter 2, and the same set of screens you walk through when setting up a new virtual machine. You are presented first with an option to create a new disk or attach an existing one. Usually you want to create a new disk.

![*Create New Disk*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/create-new.png "Create New")

Once that is selected you will be presented with the virtual disk type screen. Since we will be working with VirtualBox, the default setting of VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) will be the best selection. But if you know this VM will be moving to another platform--you may want to choose accordingly.

![*VDI step-through*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/vdi.png "VDI")

\newpage

The next page allows you to choose either a dynamic or static allocated hard drive. Dynamic is usually the best when you are working on a laptop or other development system, as you will be creating and destroying virtual machine rapidly, and static allocations of multiple gigabytes can become an issue after some time due to your disk filling up.

![*Dynamic Filesystem*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/dynamic.png "Dynamic")

This next screen allows you to change the location of where the virtual hard disk will be stored, as well as adjust the size of this new partition.  
![*Hard Drive Size*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/size.png "Size")

The final step is to choose to attach the virtual disk you just created to the virtual machine.

![*Choose new Virtual Disk to attach*](images/Chapter-11/virtual-box/choose-new-disk.png "Image showing how to attach new virtual disk to VM")

## Disk Partitioning and Formatting

Adding a virtual disk is only the first step, there are three more steps before we can use this disk.  Though the first two steps have been largely merged into a single step over the last decade.

1) Partition the disk / create a filesystem
1) Mount the disk so that it can be used by your operating system.

According to the `fdisk` man page, `fdisk` is a dialog-driven program for the creation and manipulation of partition tables.  The term __partition__ in relation to a hard drive is an important concept.   You can think of a brand new hard drive as a large plot of land, multiple acres of land.  The land itself in that form is not very useful, just as a new hard drive added into your system is not very useful.  Just as that land needs to be partitioned up into different uses and functions, a hard drive needs to know where its partitions are. Each disk can have multiple partitions.  The `fdisk` method here is mentioned for historic reasons but is not used the installation of modern operating systems, but it is good to know where we came from.

Linux inherited a way to name each device and reference certain partitions attached to a system.  Windows simply uses the letter C, D, E, and so forth.  Linux and Unix use a device/partition nomenclature.  You can see this currently by typing the `lsblk` command, which will print out currently all the block devices, their device name and their partitions in a nice tree based format.

![*lsblk output from a virtual machine with 2 additional drives attached*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/lsblk.png "lsblk")

Here you will note that the drives are references by the prefix __sdx__ with the __x__ being the alphabet letter in incremental order.  Meaning that the first disk drive that your system detects in labeled __sda__, the next one would be __sdb__, and can you guess what the third and fourth system would be?  In the image above you notice that __sda__ has 3 partitions, sda1, sda2, and sda5.  These three partitions were created at installation time by the default Linux installer.  The first partition you can see has the character `/` in the far right column.  That is where the __root__ partition is mounted (meaning your entire filesystem). The second partition is where the `/boot` partition is mounted, and the final partition says __SWAP__ in the far right meaning this is a Linux SWAP partition--used by the operating system for moving data in and out of RAM in chunks at a time or called *pages*.

You can create partitions on a new disk for a fresh OS installation or just create a single partition to contain data.  The program mentioned above to create partitions is a program called `fdisk`.  The `fdisk` command is considered an essential and standard Linux tool and is part of the [util-linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux "Util Linux") package.  The best command to get started with when dealing with new disks and creating partitions is `sudo fdisk -l`.  This command will list the current existing disks and any partitions they may have.  It will also report the undetermined state of any newly attached disks.  See the image below for a sample output.  If you are using Fedora 22/23 you will see a bit of a different output, you will see partitions labeled __LVM__ which will be explained at the end of the chapter.  
\newpage

![*sudo fdisk -l*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/valid-partition.png "fdisk")

![*sudo fdisk -l*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/not-valid-partition.png "fdisk")

The history of the Linux `fdisk` command goes way back.  Stemming from the early 1990's hard drives at that time using the standard BIOS of the day were only allowed 4 __primary partitions__ on the operating system.  At those times, hard drives were small, and devices were expensive, and things we take for granted now, like optical drives, didn't really exist, so 4 primary partitions was thought to be more than anyone would ever need.  A primary partition could be broken up into an __extended partition__. Then each __extended partition__ could be further sub-divided into as many __logical partitions__ that fit on the drive.  At that time only one __primary partition__ could be active (or bootable and seeable) at a time, all other primary partitions would be hidden from the currently active operating system.  In this world `fdisk` was built, hence its concern with partitioning.  There has been an improvement since 2000 called LVM, which is covered and thankfully used exclusively now by default.

To work/modify a device that has no existing partitions (`sdb` in the image above). From the TLDP documentation regarding how to use `fdisk`[^ch11f122]. `fdisk` is started by typing (as root) fdisk device at the command prompt. Device might be something like /dev/hda or /dev/sda (see Section 2.1.1). The basic fdisk commands you need are:

* p print the partition table
* n create a new partition
* d delete a partition
* q quit without saving changes
* w write the new partition table and exit

To successfully create a partition on a new drive, let's select `sdb` in the example above.  The command `sudo fdisk /dev/sdb` will enter into `fdisk` and operate on this device.  Remember all *devices* are accessed through file handles in the `/dev` directory. Upon executing this command you are greeted with a status message reporting that the partition type cannot be detected or is not valid.  The error message seems a bit dated because you notice that it mentions DOS, SUN, SGI, and OSF--all outdated or unused partition types.  Similar to different languages or dialects, a partition also has to speak to an Operating system, and each operating system does it a bit different because of how particular filesystems are architected.  Fortunately this is a simple choice for us as we only need a Linux and a Linux SWAP partition for our uses--the rest are just artifacts of the past.

![*sudo fdisk /dev/sdb*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/fdisk.png "fdisk")

Always type __m__ for menu because the single letter commands are not intuitive.

![*m for menu*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/m-for-menu.png "Menu")

If you type the letter __l__ you will see the entire list of possible partitions, we are only interested in the value hex 82 and 83.  The next command to type is __p__ for printing out the current partition table--which will be blank.

\newpage

![*p for print*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/p-for-print.png "Print")

The next step is to type the __n__ command to create a new partition.  You will be presented with two choices for your new partition.  In this case you can select __primary partition__.  In most cases in creating data drives you can select primary partitions without concern.  If you find yourself creating many data drives or creating triple and quad bootable systems (multiple operating systems)  then you will want to conserve those primary partitions and use __extended/logical__ partitioning.

![*n is for new partition*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/n-for-new.png "New")

You are then presented with a series of options to choose a partition number, the beginning sector of your partition (usually best to choose the default) and the finishing sector (how big do you want your disk).  You can specify in a known quantity of K=kilobytes, M=megabytes, G=Gigabytes and prefacing that value with a __+__.  Selecting the default for the option of last sector will automatically fill up your disk with 1 single large partition.

![*New Partition Options*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/n-options.png "Options")

Let's see if our partition was created successfully.  You can type __m__ to display the menu again or type the __p__ directly to print out the current partition table.  You will notice that it has been modified.

![*Successful Partition Creation*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/p-finished.png "Finished")

\newpage

Everything looks good, but DON'T QUIT YET!  If you type __q__ now your changes will not be saved, and no partition information will be written.   Now you need to type __w__ to write the new partition data to the disk you are working on. The __w__ command will write and quit out automatically for you. After writing this partition data, you will see if show up in the `sudo fdisk -l` command.  After you see your new partition in `fdisk` of `lsblk` you are ready to move on to the next step of formatting a partition with a filesystem.

![*Write the Partition table data to disk*](images/Chapter-11/fdisk/w-for-write.png "Write")

### Drawbacks of disk partitions

Using the `fdisk` command does have its drawbacks.  The tool was designed in the day when systems had 1 or 2 hard drives.  Filesystems handled small files and the idea of large files partitions that spanned multiple disks was not possible due to software and processor limitations.  But we see with the cost of disk alone, systems having 24 or more hard drives is not unheard of.  Most filesystems were designed around the limitations of `fdisk` and since then new solutions have been designed to overcome the limitations of partitions such as LVM and filesystem extents, which we will cover at the end of this chapter.

## Logical Volume Manager - LVM

Partitioning of disks worked well when you had one disk and needed to create *logical* disks or partitions. But what happens when you have multiple disks or want to create a *logical* disk that spans many *physical* disks. Once a partition has been created it is not easily resized or expanded. Similarly partitions do not have a capacity for taking `filesystem level snaphosts`. Early Linux filesystems, such as ext4 did not handle volume management and left that to the Operating System.

The first solution to add Volume Management to partitioning was called LVM: [Logical Volume Management](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ "LVM"), created in 1998. LVM version 2 is the current full featured version baked in to the [Linux kernel since version 2.6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux) "LVM 2").

Instead of the standard way of partitioning up disks, we have logical groupings of disks to create partitions that span physcial media. LVM takes our single large disk and supplemented it with multiple disks in place of those partitions. *"Logical volume management provides a higher-level view of the disk storage on a computer system than the traditional view of disks and partitions. This gives the system administrator much more flexibility in allocating storage to applications and users[^130]."*

![*LVM diagram*](images/Chapter-11/LVM/LVM.png "LVM")

This diagram creates three concepts to know when dealing with LVM:

* Physical Volume (PV) - A physical volume is typically a hard disk, though it may well just be a device that 'looks' like a hard disk (eg. a software raid device)[^132]
* Volume Group (VG) - The Volume Group is the highest level abstraction used within the LVM. It gathers together a collection of Logical Volumes and Physical Volumes into one administrative unit[^131]
* Logical Volume (LV) -  The equivalent of a disk partition in a non-LVM system. The LV is visible as a standard block device; as such the LV can contain a file system (eg. /home)[^133]
  * Physical Extent (PE) - This is the unit of storage (blocks) that a PV is split into
  * Logical Extent (LE) - This matches the PE and is used when multiple PVs are added to an LG, to make the *logical disk*
    * The LVM counts how many extents are possible and makes this its *disk* so to speak

### Physical Volumes

The first thing to do in creating an LVM partition is to figure out what kind of disks you have and what kind of partition scheme you want to use. Note that you can choose to use the entire disk `/dev/sdb` for instance or you can create a partition on the disk for use with LVM; if you do make sure to create the partition of type __0x8E__ LVM and not a standard Linux partition. In order to use entire disks you need to use the `pvcreate` command to *create* physical volumes, same case with the partition. 

#### Create an LVM Physical Volume

Once you have added additional hard disks to your virtual machine, you can use the command `lsblk` to list all disks. Then use the command `sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb` to register a disk as an LVM Physical Volume (PV). You can display the details of your physical volumes with the command: `sudo pvdisplay`.

### Volume Groups

Once you have added the disks/partitions to the PV, now you need to create a Volume Group (VG) to add those PVs to. The command to add PVs to an LG is: `vgcreate VG-NAME /dev/sdx /dev/sdy`. You can extend this volume group by simply adding another `pvcreate /dev/sdx1` command for example and then using the `vgextend VG-NAME /dev/sdz`. There is also a `vgreduce` command that will remove a PV from a Volume Group.  

The volume group allows for a single logical management unit for multiple disk/partitions. This is useful as well for adding additional storage and removing storage devices that may have failed or are not performing at required parameters. You can display the details of your volume groups with the command: `sudo vgdisplay`.

### Logical Volumes

From within our Volume Group (VG) we can now carve out smaller LV (Logical Volumes).  The nice part here is that the Logical Volumes don't have to match any partition or disk size--since they are logically based on the combined size of the Volume Group which has extents mapped across those disks.  Use the command `sudo lvcreate -n LV-NAME --size 250G VG-NAME`. The `vgdisplay` command will show what had been created and what is attached to where. There are options to make the LV striped extents as opposed to linear, but that is an application based decision.

### Extending Logical Volumes

Since LVs are logical they can also be extended and reduced on the fly.  

* The command `sudo lvextend -L 50G /dev/VG-NAME/LV-NAME` will extend the LV to become 50 GB in size. 
* Using `-L+50G` will add 50 additional gigabytes to an existing LV's size. 
* Using the command `sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/VG-NAME/LV-NAME` will extend the disk to fill all additional free space
  * Find the device name, run the command: `df -H`
  * Note you have to run the command `sudo resize2fs /dev/VG-NAME/LV-NAME`
  * This will resize the filesystem to the size you extended your logical volume to

### LVM Snapshots

One definite feature not included in traditional partitioning is the concept of **snapshots**. **Snapshots** exist at the filesystem level in Btrfs and ZFS, but not XFS or ext4 as they are too old. The command `sudo lvcreate -s -n NAME-OF-SNAPSHOT -L 5g VOLUME-GROUP-NAME` creates a LV volume that is a snapshot or CoW, Copy-on-Write partition.

```bash
sudo lvcreate -L1000M -s -n lv-group-snapshot /dev/vg-group/lv-group
```

When dealing with LVM there is an ability to provide a snapshot, that is a point in time exact copy of a logical volume[^139]. The snapshot can be a smaller disk size because this new LV is only going to copy the changes, or deltas, from the original LV, not duplicating data but sharing it between the two LVs. This delta can be merged back in, returning you to a point in time state, via the command:

```bash
sudo lvconvert --merge /dev/vg-group/lv-group-snapshot
```

Assuming your have your physical volumes, your volume groups, and logical volumes created, lets now create a snapshot of a logical volume (assume that we formatted the logical volume with ext4 and mounted it to `/mnt/disk1`).

```bash
# This works with ext4, but XFS requires two additional commands
# https://learn.redhat.com/t5/Platform-Linux/How-to-Mounting-an-XFS-LVM-snapshot/td-p/287
# xfs_repair and xfs_admin
cd /mnt/disk1
# command to create a random file of 5MB
head -c 5MB /dev/urandom > datafile.txt
ls -lh
# Picking up from the tutorial at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/snapshots_backup.html
sudo lvcreate -L1000M -s -n disk1snapshot /dev/volgroupname/logicalvolname
# Type the random command to change the data since the original snapshot
head -c 25MB /dev/urandom >> datafile.txt
# You will now have a new device called /dev/volgroupname/disk-backup
# Mount this to /mnt/disk2
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disk2
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/volgroupname/disk1snapshot /mnt/disk2
cd /mnt/disk2
ls -l
ls -l /mnt/disk1
# What do you see?  Why?
```

You can remove the snapshots by unmounting the partition `umount` and the using the `lvremove` command.

## Filesystems

To extend our analogy of a disk drive being like land, and a partition being like different lots of land sold off to different people, then a filesystem would be the actual building that is built on the property to make use of the land, be it farm land, nature preserve, solar plant, or factory. A __filesystem__ is the way that an operating system addresses, stores, and retrieves data stored on a disk. It is an in-between layer so the operating system can have an addressing scheme for data, without having to know the exact mapping of the particular disk drive in question.

If you have used Windows before you are familiar with FAT32 and NTFS filesystems. Since Windows is created and curated by Microsoft, there has only been two different filesystems in the history of Windows. Linux on the other-hand supports multiple different filesystems that serve many different purposes.

### ext/ext2

The MINIX filesystem was the first Linux based filesystem released in 1991. It was borrowed conceptually from the Minix operating system that Andrew Tanenbaum had created. It had severe limitations since MINIX filesystem was engineered to be *ultra* backwards compatible--hence had 16 bit offsets and had a maximum partition size of 64 megabytes. By 1992 and Linux 0.96c a new filesystem replacement called __ext__ was created and brought into Linux as the native filesystem. By January of 1993, __ext2__ had been created and additional features added, including future proofing the system by adding unused options that could later on be tested and added as need arose.  Like most operating systems, data is broken up into __blocks__, which is the smallest sized piece of data that can be read or written by the operating system[^ch11f123].

: Limits of ext2

----------------------  ------- ------- ------- -------
Block size:              1 KiB   2 KiB   4 KiB   8 KiB
max. file size:          16 GiB 256 GiB  2 TiB   2 TiB
max. filesystem size:    4 TiB  8 TiB    16 TiB  32 TiB
----------------------  ------- ------- ------- -------

Traditionally your `/boot` partition is formatted as __ext2__ because it is only used for a short time to load your *initrd* and *kernel image* into memory, so the overhead of __ext4__ is not needed.  You can use the built in `sudo mkfs` command to format a partition with __ext2__.

### ext3/ext4

By 2001, as filesystems became larger, the amount of data being written increased and the chances for data corruption or disk writes to fail became more evident and critical. The CPU could now handle to overhead of managing data writes to disk to ensure that those operations actually happened.

 *"A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the intentions of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log. In the event of a system crash or power failure, such file systems can be brought back online quicker with lower likelihood of becoming corrupted[^124] [^125]."*

Not to be confused with journald from systemd, the __ext3__ filesystem, introduced to the Linux kernel the journaling feature in 2001. Being an extension basically of __ext2__, __ext3__ began to inherit legacy problems of __ext__ and __ext2__ as they were now over a decade old.

: Limits of ext3

Block size   Max file size   Max file system size
----------- --------------- ----------------------
  1 KiB         16 GiB             4 TiB
  2 KiB         256 GiB            8 TiB
  4 KiB         2 TiB             16 TiB
----------- --------------- ----------------------

By 2008 it became apparent that ext3 has reached the end of its development, and [Theodore Ts'o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Ts%27o "Ts'o") announced that __ext4__ would extend the __ext__ filesystem a bit longer, but the growth of __ext__ had hit the end, and a newer filesystem needed to be developed to handle the larger sets of data and the massively improved hardware that existed since 1992, when ext was developed.  A major drawback of ext4 is the lack of snapshot support (like LVM) and the need to be backward compatible with ext2.

Ext4 saw the capacity extension of __ext3__ and introduction to __extents__. The __ext4__ filesystem can support volumes with sizes up to 1 exibyte (EiB) and files with sizes up to 16 tebibytes (TiB).

In ext4, __extents__ replaced the traditional block mapping scheme used by ext2 and ext3. An extent is a range of contiguous physical blocks, improving large file performance and reducing fragmentation. A single extent in __ext4__ can map up to 128 MiB of contiguous space with a 4 KiB block size [^126].  The advantage is that the smaller 4KB blocks are bound contiguously on disk together.

Theodore Ts'o is a respected developer in the open source community, who currently is the maintainer of __ext4__ and is employed by Google to develop filesystems.  __Ext4__ is the current default file system for most Linux distros, though that is changing as OpenSuse and Fedora have adopted using Btrfs and Ubuntu is working on adopting OpenZFS as their default filesystem.  The advantage of ext4 is it is well tested and a well known quantity and is currently used by Google in Android devices as well.  To format a partition using the __ext4__ filesystem you would simply type `mkfs.ext4` and the partition will be formatted. You normally don't format entire devices, just partitions, which can take up entire disks. There are three additional competing filesystems since 2008 that fill the void left by __ext4__.

### Giga vs Gibi

These matter because humans and computers (and marketing) use different numbering systems.

### XFS

XFS is a robust and highly-scalable single host 64-bit journaling file system. It is entirely extent-based, so it supports very large files and file system sizes. The maximum supported file system size is 100 TB. The number of files an XFS system can hold is limited only by the space available in the file system[^127].

XFS was originally created by SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc) back in 1993 to be a high-end Unix work station filesystem. SGI was the company that made computers in the 1990's for high end move special effects and graphical simulation. They had their own version of Unix called IRIX, and needed a filesystem capable of handling large files at that time, and places like NASA which had large amounts of data to store and access. SGI created XFS to suit that need. XFS excels in the execution of parallel input/output (I/O) operations due to its design, which is based on allocation groups (a type of subdivision of the physical volumes in which XFS is used-also shortened to AGs). Because of this, XFS enables extreme scalability of I/O threads, file system bandwidth, and size of files and of the file system itself when spanning multiple physical storage devices[^127].

XFS was ported to Linux in 2001 as SGI and IRIX went out of business and the filesystem languished. It was opensourced and GPL'd in 2002. Red Hat began to see this filesystem as an alternative to ext4 and more mature than other replacements since it had over 10 years of development from the start to handle large sized files. Red Hat also hired many of the SGI engineers and developers who created this filesystem and brought it back into production quality. Red Hat began with RHEL 7 to deprecate ext4 as the default filesystem and implement XFS as their standard filesystem on the RHEL product.

XFS is notoriously bad at being used by an everyday computer because its strength is built on storing large database files or using large files. You can install the tools needed to make a partition of the XFS format by typing `sudo apt-get install xfsprogs`; the XFS tools are already installed on Fedora and CentOS by default. You can create an XFS filesystem using the `sudo mkfs.xfs` command. We can grow an XFS filesystem with the command `xfs_growfs /mount/point -D size`.

### Next Generation Linux Filesystems

The ext4 filesystem served its purpose well but by 2008 became apparent that ext4 was not the right filesystem design for taking full advantage of memory, disk, and processor improvements--as well as the changing use case of computing focusing on large dynamic clusters such as service companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media companies. These new generation of filesystems combine  the filesystem, volume management, data compression, volume snapshots, and datafile integrity. The two main candidates that are opensource and designed to take advantage of this current technological environment are [Btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page "btrfs wiki page") and [OpenZFS](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page "openZFS wiki page").

### Btrfs

This project was initially created by Chris Mason at Oracle in 2007, for use on their own storage products to compete against SUN Microsystems ZFS filesystem. By 2013 it was considered stable and included in the Linux Kernel. Facebook is currently where Chris Mason is employed and they are championing the use of this filesystem on [their infrastructure](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/btrfs/docs/btrfs-facebook.html "Facebook use of btrfs website").  

Btrfs is a modern copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem for Linux. Copy-on-write is at its core and optimization pattern that uses pointers instead of making multiple copies of data on a disk, therefore reducing write operations. When the original file is modified then a true on disk copy of the file is made[^ch11f121]. Chris Mason said the goal of Btrfs is, *"to let Linux scale for the storage that will be available. Scaling is not just about addressing the storage but also means being able to administer and to manage it with a clean interface that lets people see what's being used and makes it more reliable[^128]."*

Btrfs adds support for resource pooling and using extents to make logical drives across physical devices removing the need for the use of LVM, volume management is now built in. Recently openSUSE and Fedora have adopted Btrfs as a filesystem, but support for Btrfs was remove in RHEL 8 (in favor of XFS and LVM).

| Operating System | Default Filesystem | Filesystem Support |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Ubuntu Desktop   |       ext4         |   zfs and btrfs    |
| Ubuntu Server    |       ext4         |   zfs and btrfs    |
| Fedora Workstation |    btrfs         |   xfs    |
| Alma, RHEL, & Rocky Linux   |       xfs         |   -   |  
| Debian         | ext4  |  zfs, xfs, btrfs |

### Btrfs Creation Commands

* Create a btrfs file system on a single device. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1`
* Create a btrfs file system with a label that you can use when mounting the file system. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs -L myvolume /dev/sdb2`
  * Note: The device must correspond to a partition if you intend to mount it by specifying the name of its label.
* Create a btrfs file system on a single device, but do not duplicate the metadata on that device. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs -m single /dev/sdc`
* Stripe the file system data and mirror the file system metadata across several devices. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdd /dev/sde`
* Stripe both the file system data and metadata across several devices. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs -m raid0 /dev/sdd /dev/sde`
* Mirror both the file system data and metadata across several devices. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs -d raid1 /dev/sdd /dev/sde`
* Stripe the file system data and metadata across several mirrored devices. You must specify an even number of devices, of which there must be at least four. For example:
  * `mkfs.btrfs -d raid10 -m raid10 /dev/sdf /dev/sdg /dev/sdh /dev/sdi /dev/sdj /dev/sdk`

Btrfs extensive documentation can be found at Oracle's website: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_create_btrfs.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_create_btrfs.html "Oracle's Btrfs website")

#### ZFS and it's Design Philosophy

> "*More than a file system, ZFS is fundamentally different from traditional file systems. Combining the traditionally separate roles of volume manager and file system provides ZFS with unique advantages. The file system is now aware of the underlying structure of the disks. Traditional file systems could exist on a single disk alone at a time. If there were two disks then creating two separate file systems was necessary. A traditional hardware RAID configuration avoided this problem by presenting the operating system with a single logical disk made up of the space provided by physical disks on top of which the operating system placed a file system."*

> *"ZFS is an elegantly designed filesystem: *"ZFS is a combined file system and logical volume manager designed by Sun Microsystems. The features of ZFS include protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, efficient data compression, integration of the concepts of filesystem and volume management, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, Software based RAID, (RAID-Z)[^129]."*

### ZFS

ZFS is a filesystem originally developed by Sun for their Solaris Unix operating system and in use since 2001. ZFS was opensourced by SUN in 2005 under the CDDL license (similar to the Mozilla Public License) but incompatible with the GPL. Oracle inherited ZFS when it purchased Sun Microsystems in 2010. ZFS is not licensed under the GPL but under a CopyLeft license called the [CDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Development_and_Distribution_License "CDDL"), which is similar to the GPL, but allowes the inclusion of proprietary files with opensource code. 

ZFS therefore cannot be part of Linux natively and some arguments would say that it cannot be part of Linux at all. Canonical, Ubuntu's parent company, disagreed with this, and began to offer OpenZFS natively as part of their operating system. The argument of integrating CDDL based ZFS code into GPLv2 Linux Kernel was extensive with the FSF coming down in opposition of Ubuntu's interpretation of the GPL.

* [GPL Violations Related to Combining ZFS and Linux](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/ "GPL Violations Related to Combining ZFS and Linux")
* [Interpreting, enforcing and changing the GNU GPL, as applied to combining Linux and ZFS](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/zfs-and-linux "Interpreting, enforcing and changing the GNU GPL, as applied to combining Linux and ZFS")
* [Ubuntu ZFS announcement](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2016/02/16/zfs-is-the-fs-for-containers-in-ubuntu-16-04 "Ubuntu ZFS Annoucement")

FreeBSD didn't have this restriction under the BSD license and they have had native kernel based support for ZFS since version 9 of FreeBSD and ZFS is a supported filesystem type on MacOS. As of Ubuntu 16.04, you can install ZFS via apt-get and include the CDDL licensed ZFS code on Linux as a loadable kernel module. Ubuntu is beginning to support root partition being ZFS on the desktop.  

Development of all ZFS code now lives in the upstream [OpenZFS project](https://openzfs.org/wiki/Main_Page "OpenZFS wikipage"). Since the ZFS code was opensourced, when Oracle tried to "closesource" the code base in 2010, essentially what Oracle did was make a fork of the project and keep their changes proprietary. The rest of the community took ZFS and made the OpenZFS community, which now consolidates various ZFS code bases into a single repo for MacOS, FreeBSD, and Linux as a loadable kernel module. Red Hat has not participated in the Linux development of OpenZFS as most companies are afraid of potential litigation and lawsuits from Oracle (real or perceived). There is even a ZFS developer port who brought [ZFS to Windows](https://github.com/openzfsonwindows/ZFSin "ZFS on Windows"), using the latest Windows OS.

#### ZFS Installation

Here is an example to install the ZFS module, load the module, and then format and create a zpool logical mirror (RAID1) in a few steps, tutorial comes from here: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/ZFS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/ZFS "ZFS Tutorial").

```bash
# See that the zfs module is not loaded
modprobe zfs
lsmod | grep zfs

sudo apt install zfsutils-linux

# Now check to see if the zfs module is loaded
modprobe zfs
lsmod | grep zfs
```

### ZFS Concepts

ArsTechnica published an excellent [ZFS primer](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/zfs-101-understanding-zfs-storage-and-performance/ "webpage ZFS primer") and Oracle maintains documentation for their [ZFS distro](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26505_01/html/E37384/zfsover-1.html#scrolltoc "webpage for Oracle ZFS"), which is still good for general reference and the OpenZFS also maintains [documentation for OpenZDS](https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/index.html "webpage for OpenZFS").

The main convention in ZFS is the `zpool`. A `zpool` is a logical construct that contains `vdevs`, which have physical devices -- very similar to the LVM abstractions. There is the ability to create special `vdevs` for read and write caching to speed up/optimize disk operations on a system using fast SSD drives as these special cache devices. 

Within a `zpool` you can create `datasets` which are *soft partition* that don't have a fixed size. These `datasets` can have individual features such as quotas, file compression, or encryption turned on. ZFS also has the ability to take point-in-time snapshots of these `datasets` that can be promoted to filesystems. All data is written in 128 KiB blocks or data across a zpools contents.

### Advanced ZFS Disks and RAID-Z

ZFS supports creating multiple types of redundant disks that increase speed or increase redundancy, such as:

* ZFS stripe
  * Two or more disks that are collected into a single logical disks in order to speed up writes at the expense of redundancy
  * Also known as a [RAID 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0 "Raid 0 Website")
* ZFS mirror
  * Disks in pairs of 2 that mirror each other's writes for fail over protection in case of disk failure
  * Also known as a [RAID 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1 "Raid 1 website")
* ZFS stripped mirror
  * Two or more disks that are striped and then mirrored for redundancy but also gains the advantage of the stripes speed
  * Also known as a RAID 10
* ZFS RAID-Z
  * Using multiple disks and redundancy to support multiple disk failure and recovery
  * Also known as a [RAID 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_5 "Raid 5 website")
  * Software based RAID
  * Supports Hotspare disks
  * Can support 1, 2, and 3 parity disks

```bash

# Assume each disk is 2 GB in size
# Create a Stripe of 3 disks for a single 6 GB logical volume
sudo zpool create datastripe /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
sudo zpool status

# Create a Mirror of 2 disks for a single 2 GB logical volume
# with failover protection
sudo zpool create datamirror mirror /dev/sde /dev/sdf
sudo zpool status

# Create a Striped Mirror of 4 disks for a logical volume of 4 GB
# with failover protection
sudo zpool create sm mirror /dev/sdg /dev/sdh /dev/sdi /dev/sdj
sudo zpool status

# Like RAID5, this uses a variable width strip for parity. Allows one to get 
# the most capacity out of a bunch of disks with parity checking with a 
# sacrifice to some performance
# https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/zfs
# https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/ZFS
sudo zpool create example raidz /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd /dev/sde
sudo zpool status
```

### ZFS Datasets

ZFS has a feature called `datasets`. Essentially `datasets` are a like a partition but it is a soft partition. You don't define the total space for the partition but they share the pool size. This can be good for mounting snapshots as filesystems in a pool.

* `sudo zfs create users/jeremy`
* `sudo zfs create users/joseph`

### ZFS Snapshots

ZFS has support for snapshots similar to LVM but built into the filesystem layer.  Let's demonstrate this by creating a file named **accounts.txt** on `/datamirror`.

```bash

# Create the mirror -- change the devices names as needed
sudo zpool create datamirror mirror /dev/sde /dev/sdf

# Change the owenership to of the datamirror pool
# Assume your user name is controller
sudo chown -R controller:controller /datamirror
```

```bash
# Create a file of 1GB size
cd /datamirror
# Command to create a text file of 1 GB
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file.txt bs=1M count=1000
# Command to take a snaptshot of the filesystem named todaysnap
sudo zfs snapshot datamirror@todaysnap
sudo zfs list -t snapshot
```

```bash
# Lets modify the contents of datamirror and then rollback the snapshot
# Command to create a text file of 1 GB
dd if=/dev/zero of=test-file.txt bs=1M count=1000
touch newer-accounts.txt
ls
# Lets rollback the changes to pre-snapshot
sudo zfs rollback datamirror@todaysnap
# Issue the ls command and you will see all the additional files gone
ls 
```

#### ZFS Send and Receive

ZFS also has a mechanism to send and receive snapshots, which done in a small enough increments which effectively creates a serialized synchronization feature. This can be done on the same system as well as over a network connection to a remote computer. To synchronize a ZFS filesystem:

* First create a snapshot of a zpool
* Using the `zfs send` and `zfs receive` commands via a pipe you can send your snapshot to become another partition
  * `sudo zfs send users/jeremy@20250101 | sudo zfs recv users/jeremy`
  * This promotes my snapshot to a new `dataset` named `jeremy` in the `users` pool  
* You can pipe the command over `ssh` to restore to a remote system
  * `zfs send users/jeremy@todaysnap | ssh user@hostname sudo sudo zfs recv users/jeremy`
  * You will need to use the [zfs allow command](https://xai.sh/2018/08/27/zfs-incremental-backups.html "webpage for zfs allow command") for the user on the receiving end
  * `zfs allow backupuser atime,create,destroy,mount,mountpoint,receive,rollback,snapshot,userprop targetpool/targetfs`

### Additional ZFS Features

In addition there is an L2ARC cache for caching most recent and most frequently used data blocks.  This is a separate SSD based disk and can speed up data access[^141] [^142]. The ZIL and the L2ARC if not defined on separate disks will take a small portion of the each zpool created. This is fine for low volume disk writes, but puts extra overhead on the system. If you have fast SSDs that are small in size, say 30 to 80 GB, you can stripe them and place the L2ARC cache and or ZIL on these disks. ZIL is a write only function and L2ARC cache becomes read predominant.

#### ZFS ZIL and SLOG

ZFS shines by creating additional read and write caches, called a ZIL and a SLOG. These caches enable the disks to reach and write in consistent batches or blocks of data instead of small random amounts of data. This way the disk can "report" a successful write, but the data is actually momentarily cached -- then flushed to the disk along with block of writes.

Using an existing zpool, called **datapool**, we can attach two additional disk `/dev/sde` and `/dev/sdf`. You can add the directives for the log and cache after the `zpool create` command:  `zpool add datapool cache /dev/sde2 /dev/sdf2 log mirror /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1`.  You can use the /dev/ locations of disks or you can see your UUIDs with the `blkid` or `lblkd --fs` command[^141].

"*ZFS Intent Log, or ZIL- A logging mechanism where all of the data to be the written is stored, then later flushed as a transactional write. Similar in function to a journal for journaled filesystems, like ext3 or ext4. Typically stored on platter disk. Consists of a ZIL header, which points to a list of records, ZIL blocks and a ZIL trailer. The ZIL behaves differently for different writes. For writes smaller than 64KB (by default), the ZIL stores the write data. For writes larger, the write is not stored in the ZIL, and the ZIL maintains pointers to the synched data that is stored in the log record[^140]*".

"*Separate Intent Log, or SLOG- A separate logging device that caches the synchronous parts of the ZIL before flushing them to slower disk. This would either be a battery-backed DRAM drive or a fast SSD. The SLOG only caches synchronous data, and does not cache asynchronous data. Asynchronous data will flush directly to spinning disk. Further, blocks are written a block-at-a-time, rather than as simultaneous transactions to the SLOG. If the SLOG exists, the ZIL will be moved to it rather than residing on platter disk. Everything in the SLOG will always be in system memory[^140]*".

#### ZFS Disk Scrubbing

ZFS supports disk scrubbing. Which will check every block of data against its own checksum meta-data and clean up any silent corruption. ZFS has a known good list of checksums of all blocks of data, and is constantly watching for corruption of data. Scrubs do not happen automatically but can be scheduled to run periodically. You can check the status of a disk with the command `zpool status datapool` and execute a scrub command `zpool scrub datapool`.

#### ZFS Transparent Disk Compression

ZFS can enable transparent compression using GZIP or LZ4 with a simple set command: `zfs set compression=lz4 datapool`. This can help and there is little overhead.  Finally ZFS supports data-deduplication on a file basis. If enabled each file is hashed with sha-256 and any files that match, only 1 of the files is kept, the others have markers pointing back to this original file. This saves the overall amount of data you are storing and can reduce costs but the cost is high in amount of ram needed to store the de-dupe tables. You can display the current compression level with the command: `sudo zfs get compression mydatapool`.

#### Finding a physical disk

![*HP HP EVA4400 storage array*](images/Chapter-11/disk/278px-HP_EVA4400-1.jpg "HP storage array")[^144]

ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM have the ability to remove disks from pools and volumes. The trouble is you can remove the disk logically--but how do you identify which physical disk it is? Luckily each disk has a serial number printed on the top of it. When working in these scenarios you should have all of these serial numbers written down as well as the location of where that disk is. You can find the serial number of the disk via the `hdparm` tool. This script would enumerate through all of the disks you have on a system and print the values out.  Note the a, b, c, are a list of the device names. In this case there is hard drive `/dev/sda` through `/dev/sdg`[^143] run the command on your system and see what comes out.

```bash
  for i in a b c d e f g;
  do
    echo -n "/dev/sd$i: "
    hdparm -I /dev/sd$i | awk '/Serial Number/ {print $3}'
  done
```

```bash
#If you are missing those tools, just install following packages
sudo apt-get install hdparm
sudo apt-get install smartmontools
sudo apt-get install lshw

# These commands all will show you information relating to the disk serial number
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/121757/harddisk-serial-number-from-terminal

### HFS+, UFS, and APFS

The BSD systems has its own filesystem, UFS: [the Unix File System](http://www.ivoras.net/blog/tree/2013-10-24.why-ufs-in-freebsd-is-great.html "Unix Filesystem"). This filesystem was native to Unix going back to the System 7 Unix release.  Though UFS has been updated since and is officially UFS2, which was released around 1994 when BSD split from Unix due to the AT&T lawsuit.  UFS2 is considered similar to ext4 on Linux in capabilities at the current time.  FreeBSD and then other BSDs adopted ZFS to be able to extend the filesystem, capability of UFS.  All Illumos, or OpenSolaris based distros use ZFS natively as well, but [BSD based systems have switched](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=FreeBSD-ZFS-On-Linux "BSD rebases to ZFS on Linux") their ZFS to be based on the [ZFS on Linux](https://zfsonlinux.org/ "ZFS on Linux") code base due to a larger developer and feature base.

Apple had been using their own filesystem called HFS+ which was introduced in 1998 in MacOS 8.1 in 1998.  Features were added over time and in each release to keep the filesystem with feature parity for ext4.  This was used as the standard file system on all Mac and iOS devices until 2016/2017 when a new Apple designed filesystem was released across devices. Why a new filesystem? Think about it, by 2016 what was the primary device that Apple was selling compared to 1998?  What type of storage media had HFS+ been designed for?   What type of storage media was running on the new Apple systems, in laptops and mobile?

Though Apple Was one of the first companies to [port ZFS to MacOS](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2016/06/15/apple_and_zfs/ "Apple ports ZFS to MacOS"), which is BSD based, eventually they decided to deploy a new filesystem called APFS (apple filesystem) which has a mix of ZFS like features that were home grown by Apple and more importantly not under the control of another company or any particular free or opensource licenses.  The goal for Apple was to use this filesystem across their platform, from MacOS to iOS devices with a focus on Flash bashed (SSD and NVMe) devices that HFS+ wasn't designed for.  The system has a similar feature set to ZFs and Btrfs such as encryption and snapshots, but [is missing data integrity](http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2016/06/19/apfs-part1/ "Review of APFS").

### F2FS and EROFS

Due to the increased use of NAND or Flash based memory storage such as SSD, eMMC, and SD cards, a consortium of companies dealing with mobile devices came together in 2012 to create a filesystem which takes the nature of Flash into direct account in order to overcome some of the weaknesses of Flash based storage. F2FS stands for Flash-Friendly File System, and was developed by Samsung Electronics, Motorola Mobility, Huawei and Google.  The F2FS systems was adopted for some devices in 2012-2016 and saw a resurgence in use by 2018 led by the Pixel 3 and Motorola devices.

Hauwei replaced F2FS on their Honor devices with the [Enhanced Read-Only File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EROFS "EROFS wiki page"), or EROFS.  It is designed and maintained by Huawei and is used on their own Android based devices introduced in 2018 and is part of the Linux Kernel.

### DragonFly BSD and Hammer FS

DragonFly BSD developer Matthew Dillion has been spearheading the development of his own distributed cluster based filesystem called [Hammer](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/hammer/ "Hammer Filesystem").  His goal is to have finer grained snapshoting--even per file on a constant basis and make snapshots almost a constant occurrence across the filesystem for easy migration of a filesystem to a different Hammer Cluster (migration over a network).   Work has recently finished on the Hammer 2 file system which is now an option for installation on DragonFly BSD 5.2+.  The Clustering feature is still a work in progress though, but Hammer has similar ZFS and Btrfs style features of file system and volume-management.  HammerFS is DragonFly BSD code, though it could be ported to other BSDs, the DragonFly internals have diverged so far that this becomes essentially impossible.

## Mounting and Unmounting of disks

Once a disk is partitioned, and formatted with a filesystem, it now needs to be mounted. The concept of mounting came from the UNIX days of carrying a large reel of magnetic tape, and physically mounting it on a tape reader.  You can see all the mount points currently attached to your system by typing `/etc/mtab`.  A filesystem needs to be mounted to a directory location. Technically your root filesystem is mounted to the `/` partition.

In the previous examples we we have created partitions and filesystem, now let us mount them.  The first step we need to do is provide a mount point.  Traditionally that is done in the `/mnt` directory.  You should create your __mountpoints__ here. Let's type `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data-drive`. The name *data-drive* is an arbitrary name I have given my newly created __mountpoint__.  The `-p` flag will auto-create any subdirectory under `/mnt` that doesn't already exist.  Why did I type `sudo`?  Who owns the `/mnt` directory?

Once this directory is created, you can use the `mount` command like this: `sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb /mnt/data-drive`.  The `-t` flag tells this mount that the filesystem is of type __ext4__ and the operating system needs to know so that it can interface correctly with the filesystem.  Once this is done, the directory will still be owned by root, you probably need to change the ownership of the directory so that you own and can write to it. How would you do that based on last chapter?  You could type `sudo chown controller:controller /mnt/data-drive`, assuming your username is *controller*.

The partition can be unmounted by typing the `umount` command--yes it is missing the __n__.  Be careful you don't try to unmount the device while your pwd is in a directory on that mount--otherwise you will get a *device is busy error.*

### /etc/fstab

The `/etc/fstab` file controls the automatic mounting of your filesystems at boot.  Every time your system boots, technically each partition is remounted every time too.  If you create your own filesystem and want it mounted automatically on boot, then you would need to add an entry here. The `/etc/fstab` file has 6 columns containing values listed here: `<device> <mount point> <fs type> <options> <dump> <pass>`.

An example entry could contain these values: `/dev/sdb1 /mnt/data-drive  ext4  defaults  0   0`.  Devices now are typically listed by their UUID, which can be found by typing `ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid` or `lsblk --fs /dev/sda`.  That is the actual command not a place holder. This is where the long strings you see in the `/etc/fstab` file in place of the device name.  

The use of UUIDs is a better idea as once a UUID is given, even if the device name changes the UUID will not.  Here is a sample `/etc/fstab` file showing UUID based fstab with an additional disk being mounted.

```bash
# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
UUID=e720a798-b02c-4e3f-8132-8f67f2be0c2c /           ext4    errors=remount-ro 0 1
/swapfile                                 none        swap    sw                0 0
UUID=003e6f67-9d31-4198-b3dd-4447f2337445 /mnt/disk2  btrfs   defaults          0 0
```

There are many options that can be set in the place of `defaults` or appended via a "," such as:

1. sync/async - All I/O to the file system should be done (a)synchronously.
2. auto - The filesystem can be mounted automatically (at bootup, or when mount is passed the -a option). This is really unnecessary as this is the default action of mount -a anyway.
3. noauto - The filesystem will NOT be automatically mounted at startup, or when mount passed -a. You must explicitly mount the filesystem.
4. dev/nodev - Interpret/Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.
5. exec / noexec - Permit/Prevent the execution of binaries from the filesystem.
6. suid/nosuid - Permit/Block the operation of suid, and sgid bits.
7. ro - Mount read-only.
8. rw - Mount read-write.
9. user - Permit any user to mount the filesystem. This automatically implies noexec, nosuid,nodev unless overridden.
10. nouser - Only permit root to mount the filesystem. This is also a default setting.
11. defaults - Use default settings. Equivalent to rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async.
12. netdev - this is a network device, mount it after bringing up the network. Only valid with fstype nfs.

### systemd Mounting Unit Files

Usually systemd will strive to absorb functions, but according to the man page for systemd.mount, *"Mounts listed in /etc/fstab will be converted into native units dynamically at boot and when the configuration of the system manager is reloaded. In general, configuring mount points through /etc/fstab is the preferred approach. See systemd-fstab-generator(8) for details about the conversion.*" ZFS will take care of automounting its own partitions. Btrfs you will need to add an entry using the UUID instead of the dev name which you can find via the `blkid` command.

Systemd has absorbed the purpose of the `/etc/fstab` file by creating **.mount** files. Systemd processes `.mount` files first then processes the `/etc/fstab` file.  Let's look at an example where we have already created a Btrfs filesystem on a new virtual disk. By using the `lsblk --fs` command we can retrieve the UUID of the disk. The reason we would want look at using the UUID instead of the `/dev/sdx` is that once assigned the UUID won't change. The device designation can change. Say for instance that a hard drive fails, on reboot your system will re-enumerate the devices and now hard drive names will be changed.

In this example the output of the command, `lsblk --fs` will look like this (assuming you have attached the virtual disk and formatted it as Btrfs):

```bash
sda
sda1   ext4           e720a798-b02c-4e3f-8132-8f67f2be0c2c /
sdb    btrfs          003e6f67-9d31-4198-b3dd-4447f2337445
sdc    btrfs          62bab009-e64e-445c-bf33-5f2143569a83
```

```bash
# Create this file: /etc/systemd/system/mnt-databasedisk.mount
# Note that the .mount file name needs to be the same as the "Where" location
# Replace the / with -
# Make sure to enable the .mount at boot
# sudo systemctl enable mnt-databasedisk.mount
[Unit]
Description=Disk that was added to host the storage of our database

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-uuid/003e6f67-9d31-4198-b3dd-4447f2337445
Where=/mnt/databasedisk

Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Remember!** ZFS handles implicit mounting of volumes/zpools as part of the act of creating zpools and do not need to have `.mount` files created.

**Remember!** Just like `.service` and `.timer` files, via systemctl you need to start and enable your `.mount` files

### Disk related tools

There are two useful commands to use in regards to understanding the disk resource use in regards to the filesystem. The `df` command will list the disk usage. There is an optional `-H` and `-h` which presents the file-system usage in Gigabytes (-H is metric: giga, -h is binary, gibi). When you use `df` without any directories, it will list all file-systems. The command below lists the file-system that contains the user's home directory: `/home/controller` for example.

![*df -H /home/controller*](images/Chapter-11/du/df-h.png "df")

The `du` command is disk usage. This is a helpful command to show the exact *byte-count* that each file is actually using. When using `ls -l` Linux reports only 4096 kb for a directories size, this does not actually reflect the size of the content inside the directory. The `du` command will do that for you.

These commands might not report completely accurate information when dealing with next generation filesystems like ZFS and Btrfs. use the commands: `sudo btrfs filesystem usage [mountpoint]` or `sudo zfs list [poolname]`

```bash
sudo btrfs filesystem usage /mnt/databasedisk
Overall:
    Device size:         3.00GiB
    Device allocated:    331.12MiB
    Device unallocated:  2.68GiB
    Device missing:      0.00B
    Used:                320.00KiB
    Free (estimated):    2.68GiB (min: 1.35GiB)
    Data ratio:          1.00
    Metadata ratio:      2.00
    Global reserve:      3.25MiB (used: 0.00B)

Data,single: Size:8.00MiB, Used:64.00KiB
   /dev/sdc    8.00MiB

Metadata,DUP: Size:153.56MiB, Used:112.00KiB
   /dev/sdc  307.12MiB

   /dev/sdc   16.00MiB

   /dev/sdc    2.68GiB
```

> *When you compare the space consumption that is reported by the df command with the zfs list command, consider that df is reporting the pool size and not just file system sizes. In addition, df doesn't understand descendent file systems or whether snapshots exist. If any ZFS properties, such as compression and quotas, are set on file systems, reconciling the space consumption that is reported by df might be difficult[^138].*

```bash
# df -H /data1
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
data1           1.9G  132k  1.9G   1% /data1

# sudo zfs list data1
NAME    USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
data1   104K  1.75G       24K  /data1
```

## Compression and Archiving tools

If you remember the history of Unix and history of technology you remember that hard drive space was at a premium for many many years. Also the concept of discrete hard drives did not come about until the early to mid 1980s. Things we take for granted now--such as zipping a series of folders and attaching them as a single file in email were unthinkable in 1979.

### tar

By 1979 local storage had increased to the point where it was conceivable that a **t**ape **ar**chive or tar file could be taken of a directory structure for backup purposes preserve the directory structure. The `tar` command was created and first included in Unix System 7 release. The added advantage was that the tar file could be transferred as a single file, thereby reducing network overhead and os seek-time but retain a hierarchy of directories. This method also became the preferred way to distribute code that was used to compile applications. One could just un-tar an archive and then compile the code knowing that the directory structure of the included files was correctly preserved.  

The tar command only does archiving and does not do any compression--only preserving of file structure in the same way that an ISO file preserves structure.  The tar archive by convention is assigned a file extension of __.tar__ but this is not added automatically.

> __Example Usage:__ `tar -cvf code.tar ./code-directory` This command will create a `tar` archive of the directory called code-directory. tar \[options\] \[archive name and location\] \[what to archive\]

> __Example Usage:__ `tar -xvf code.tar` This command will unpack or extract a `tar` archive of the directory called code-directory and place it in the `pwd`.

### compress

As file sizes grew the need to compress redundant data became apparent.  In dealing with compression you have two sides and you have to choose one. Either the fast time to compress and larger file sizes, or slower time to compress and smaller file sizes. The initial compression algorithms went for the faster compression but larger file option.  The first compression tool on Unix was called `compress`.  But it was encumbered by a patent on the [LZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch "LZW") compression algorithm, the same patent on that lead to the creation of the jpeg image standard to replace the encumbered GIF image format. Because of this compress was never *free* and outside of its invention and inclusion in commercial Unix in 1985, use could never catch on.

> Compress/Uncompress is a Unix shell compression program based on the LZW compression algorithm. Compared to more modern compression utilities such as gzip and bzip2, compress performs faster and with less memory usage, at the cost of a significantly lower compression ratio [^72].

### gzip

By 1991, Phil Katz had created an opensource implementation of LZW called [DEFLATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE "DEFLATE"). This was the basis of the popular PKZip program and the origin of the .zip compression extension. The [GNU project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip "GNU") began its own GPL based implementation using the DEFLATE algorithm and completed it by October of 1992. It was named gzip [(GNU zip)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/ "GNU zip").

> gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers[^73].

### bzip2

Bzip2 differs from gzip in that it uses the [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm "LZMA") compression algorithm which produces smaller sized files but take more CPU time and memory to compress. This is deemed an acceptable trade off as computers are only getting faster.  Decompression is very fast compared to compression. It was released in 2001[^74] and is available under a BSD-like license.  

### xz

The [xz](http://tukaani.org/xz/format.html "xz") compression tool is using the [LZMA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm "LZMA2") compression algorithm which is superior in decreasing size at the expense of compute time.  The xz algorithm uses LZMA2 which has support for multithreading in compressing and decompressing in parallel. Back in 1985 when the first Compress program was created processing power was slow compared to the speed of the networks.  Now the speed of the processor is much faster relative to the speed of our networks. On today's networks we are moving multiple gigabytes around at a time. The xz compression tool is the tool for the future. In December 2013, [kernel.org](http://kernel.org "kernel.org") announced the addition of xz compressed files and ending bzip2 compressed files for distributing the Linux kernel archive files. The xz tool works only on single files and cannot be used for archiving. In this case you would compress an archive file (like a tar file) to maximize usage.

### zstd

[Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/ "Zstandard compression website") is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios created at Facebook in 2015. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder (see benchmarks below). It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set. Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license. It can be installed via the command: `sudo apt-get install zstd`.

### tarballs

A tape archive that is additionally compressed by another tool is called a __tar ball__ and the compression method is usually appended to the end of the filename.  

>  __Example Usage:__ `tar -cvzf code.tar.gz ./code-directory` This command will create a `tar` archive of the directory called code-directory and will compress it using the gzip compression algorithm by default.  *Note the -z option added.   Add a lowercase -j for bzip2 and uppercase -J for xz. Make sure to change the file extensions.

> __Example usage:__ Each one of these tar archives has been further compressed by one of the 4 Unix/Linux compression methods `file linux-4.3-rc3.tar.Z; file linux-4.3-rc3.tar.gzip; file linux-4.3-rc3.tar.bzip2; file linux-4.3-rc3.tar.xz`

> __Example usage:__  Previously you had to pass a flag to the `tar` command to tell it what type of compression algorithm to decompress with but now `tar` is smart and will autodetect for you.  The flags you need to simply pass are -x for extract, -v for verbose (optional), and -f for file (optional) `wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.22.tar.xz; tar -xvJf linux-5.11.22.tar.xz`  

As of version > 1.31 of `tar` there is also support for zstd.  Which can be filter and archive via the `--zstd`` flag.

## Chapter Conclusions and Review

In this chapter we learned and mastered the concepts of disk based hardware.  We learned about the types of Linux filesystems and the features of the new generation of filesystems.  We learned how to install and configure volumes, snapshots, and compression. You have been prepared to with the basics of how to manage and understand the file-system on your Linux distro.

### Lab - Chapter 11

#### Lab 11 Objectives

* Creating virtual disks in VirtualBox
* Creating new logical disks using LVM
* Creating new filesystems with mkfs
* Creating new filesystems in ZFS and Btrfs
* Mounting new filesystems using the systemd `.mount` unit

#### Lab 11 Outcomes

At the conclusion of this lab you will have successfully created new virtual disks in VirtualBox. You will have succesfully created logical volumes using LVM. Finally you will have created next-generation filesystems (Btrfs and ZFS) along with systemd `.mount` unit files.

#### Lab 11 Activities

1. Create 2 virtual drives in VirtualBox (10 GB each):

   a. Use LVM to create 2 Physical Volumes
   b. Create 1 Volume Group
   c. Create 3 Logical Volumes of 5 GB each
   d. Format each LV using ext4

2. Using Fedora Linux, create 2 virtual drives in VirtualBox (10 GB each):

   a. Use LVM to create 2 Physical Volumes
   b. Create 1 Volume Group
   c. Create 3 Logical Volumes of 5 GB each
   d. Format one LV using ext4, xfs, and then btrfs

3. Using the same Fedora Linux from questions two extend the ext4 partition to be 10 GB

   a. Use the `lvextend` command to extend the LV 
   b. Use the `resize2fs` command to extend the filesystem size

4. Using the same Fedora Linux from questions two extend the xfs partition to be 10 GB

   a. Use the `lvextend` command to extend the LV 
   b. Use the `xfs_growfs` command to extend the filesystem size

5. Using Fedora Linux create 4 additional virtual disks (can be of 5-10 GB)

   a. Using Btrfs create a stripped mirror named `datastorage`
   b. Use Btrfs to print out status of Btrfs disks: `btrfs filesystem show`
   c. use the command: `btrfs filesystem df` to show filesystem use compare the results to `df -H`

6. Create a `.mount` file to mount the Btrfs disk created in previous question

   a. Run the `df -H` before creating the `.mount` file and after reboot to show the disk has been mounted
   b. You will need the UUID from the `lsblk -fs` command
   b. Remember like systemd, you will have to enable and start the `.mount` file
   c. Change ownership of the mount directory to your user
   d. Write a file named `helloworld.txt` to the newly mounted directory

7. Using Ubuntu Server, enable an additional host-only network interface and SSH from your Host OS into this system

    a. Create 3 virtual disks to attach to the virtual machine in VirtualBox
    b. Install the `zfsutils-linux` package for the zfs tools
    c. Create a 3 disk zfs stripe named: `datadisk`
    d. Change ownership of the mountpoint to your user
    e. Write a file named: `helloworld.txt` to the new mountpoint

8. Using Ubuntu Server, SSH from your Host OS into this system

    b. Attach 4 additional virtual disks to the virtual machine in VirtualBox
    c. Create a 4 disk RaidZ named: `customers`
    d. Change ownership of the mountpoint to your user
    e. Write a file named: `helloworld.txt` to the new mountpoint
    f. Display the `zpool status` and take a screenshot of the output
 
9. Using Ubuntu Server, SSH from your Host OS into this system

    b. Inside of zfspool named `customers`, create 2 `datasets` named: `customers/joseph` and `customers/evelyn`
    c. List the `datasets`
    d. Issue the command: `truncate -s 500m accounts.csv` to create a 500 mb file named accounts.csv in each dataset
    e. Create a ZFS snapshot of the volume named `customers/joseph` naming it: `customer-snap1`
    f. Using the `truncate` command create two more files: `ubuntu-distros.csv` and `fedora-distros.csv` of 100 mb on the `customers/joseph` volume
    g. Issue the `ls -lh` command on the `customers/joseph` volume to show that the new files have been created
    h. Using the `zfs list` command list the current snapshots
    i. Using the `zfs rollback` command the `customer-snap1` snapshot
    j. Issue the `ls -lh` command on the `customers/joseph` volume to show that the snapshot has been rolled back

10. Using Ubuntu Server, SSH from your Host OS

    a. Execute a `zpool status customers/evelyn` command
    b. Enable LZ4 compression on the zpool datapool
    c. Execute a `zfs get all | grep compression` command to display that compression is enabled

11. Execute any of the commands listed in the text to print out the disk serial numbers

12. Attach an additional 2 GB virtual disk and format it with Btrfs and we will mount is in read-only mode. Using the command `lsblk --fs /dev/sdX` determine the UUID of the newest virtual disk you just created. Add an entry for this disk to the `/etc/fstab` file with the following values:

    a. file system is UUID=
    b. mount point is `/mnt/disk100` (create this partition if it doesn't exist)
    c. type is btrfs
    d. options: defaults,ro  (ro for read-only)
    e. dump and pass fields can be 0
    f. Change owner and group to your username for `/mnt/disk100` (using `chmod`)
    g. Reboot your system. Change directory to `/mnt/disk100` and take a screenshot to demonstrate that the disk is in read-only mode by trying to create a file via this command:  `touch demo.txt`

13. Using `wget`, retrieve this URL: https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.11.19.tar.xz

   a. Untar/uncompress this archive.
   b. Tar the directory and compress it using bzip2, make sure to keep the original input
   c. Tar the directory and compress it using gzip, make sure to keep the original input
   d. Tar the directory and compress it using ztd, make sure to keep the original input
   e. Tar the directory and compress it using xz, make sure to keep the original input
