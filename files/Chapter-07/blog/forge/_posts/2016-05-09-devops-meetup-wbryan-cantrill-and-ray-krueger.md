<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Went to an amazing DevOps meetup here in Chicago and heard Bryan Cantrill (CTO of Joyent) speak.  He is as advertised.  Also heard from Ray Krueger, the CTO of Hilton Hotels talk about their own IT and infrastructure patterns.  </p>
<p>They posted a video of the presentation here:</p>

<p>Go to about 1:40 (1 hour 40 minutes in) to hear me ask a question about debugging and tracings place in education.</p>
<p>I highly recommend joining and attending the DevOps Chicago meetup: (free and they usually feed you)<br />
