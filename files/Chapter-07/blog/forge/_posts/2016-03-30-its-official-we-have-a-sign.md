<p>Good news our newly built and renovated Smart Tech and Embedded Systems Lab at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;web.iit.edu&#47;">Illinois Tech<&#47;a> recently got an official sign and plaque outside the main door.  Like a country isn't official until it has a flag and an anthem, now we have a sign and are an official lab.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/2016&#47;03&#47;WP_20160324_16_58_09_Pro.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1686"><img src="/assets/2016&#47;03&#47;WP_20160324_16_58_09_Pro-1024x577.jpg" alt="WP_20160324_16_58_09_Pro" width="845" height="476" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1686" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Take care,<br />
