<p>Hi 1871 Universities,</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we are beginning the internship hiring process for 1871 startups!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;r20.rs6.net&#47;tn.jsp?e=001oO2B4Wh9TgKLRJfUN2TMidjjKV-nperRfXpTjiFYaZKyprHugotOJvL6yrFKO1e0o60yRNF6Di6fS2iCV_mft81Buo7KHcUNP2le8-KxcsI=" target="_blank">1871<&#47;a> is home to 220 digital startups in downtown Chicago. Many are interested in hiring interns for the summer in a variety of functions, from software engineers to marketers to writers, business analysts to sales! Many of the internships will be paid (at startup rates) and will typically run for 8-12 weeks during the summer, with exact dates to vary by startup.</p>
