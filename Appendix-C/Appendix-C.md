### Lab

Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday involve Free and OpenSource. Choose 2 case studies from [https://highscalability.com](https://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based on these issues:  

Post your topics on the Blackboard Class Discussion board under the Chapter-02 Case Studies forum - both of your case study choices have to be unique from everyone else. Those who choose first will get the ones they want. There are over 200+ case studies there will be plenty of options.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.   Its best to find a company that you use or support.

Answer these questions (not all of the Answers are in each case study!)

1. What market does that company serve? (What do they do?) And have they always served that market?
1. What Operating System(s) are used?
1. What programming languages/frameworks are used?
1. What storage and what database technologies are used?
1. What is the current stock price and what was the IPO of the company? (if traded publicly.)

### Lab

The objectives of this lab is to use the shell commands we learned in this chapter and understand their proper usage patterns. The outcome will be that you will be able to successfully use the Linux Shell for navigation, file creation, and file modification. Resist the temptation to use the GUI file manager and a web browser.  All actions will be done through the shell unless noted.  All work can be done on either Ubuntu 18.04 desktop or Fedora 28 desktop unless noted.

Preface all screenshots with an H3 header indicated the question number: for example, Question 01, Question 02, and so forth.

1) Login to your Linux System. Using a package manager install the ```git``` program.  
    i) issue the command ```git --version``` and take a screenshot of the output
1) Navigate to your home directory and then to your Documents directory.  Issue the command ```git clone https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1.git```  (If you have done this command previously no need to redo it).
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.  
1) Issue the ```cd``` command to change directory into Linux-text-book-part-1.  Issue the command to display what type of file ```.git``` is.  Repeat the process for the file named ```./title/metadata.yaml```   
    i) Take a screen shot of the output of the previous commands.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve a copy of the Packer.io binary for Linux.  Use this URL as the argument for ```wget```:[https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip](https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip "Packer")
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```unzip``` command to unzip the binary and extract the file directly to the location ```/usr/local/bin```.  **Hint:** use the ```man unzip``` command to find out the usage option in order to accomplish this.
    i) To show this was succesful take a screenshot of the output of the command ```packer -v```.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve an archived copy of the Hadoop binaries from the web.  You can use this address as an argument to your wget command: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz "Hadoop URL")

### Lab Chapter 7

__Objectives:__ The objective of this lab is to master vi commands and shell scripts

__Outcomes:__ At the end you will have mastered the basics of vi and now be proficient in all the tools of Linux shell scripting

*Prereqs:*  You will need to install the program ```vimtutor``` for the first part.   You can do that on Ubuntu by typing ```sudo apt-get install vim vim-runtime vim-gtk``` and on Fedora by typing ```sudo dnf install vim vim-enhanced```.

1) To begin type the command ```vimtutor``` from the commandline. __Warning:__ ```vimtutor``` requires you to read the instructions carefully.
    i) This is a 6 part tutorial.  You need to follow all the steps of the 6 part tutorial making your changes directly in the file.
    i) __Be careful__ to save the file to an external location – otherwise IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN each time you launch the vimtutor command. You can do this by typing ```:w  ~/Documents/vimtutor.txt``` - this way you can edit the file on your local system instead of launching the vimtutor application again.  Note you need to use ```vim``` for this assignment.
1) Inside of the ```files/Chapter-07/lab``` folder using ```vim``` open ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```.  You will be using vim to modify this file
    i)  Use the ex command to find all occurances of ```;``` and replace them with ```&&```.
    i)  Using vim commands replace all occurances of the numbers ```2.6.5``` with ```2.8.5```.
    i)  Using vim to append the packages ```python``` and ```python-dev``` to line 18.  
    i)  In the shell script,  ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```,  using vim insert a comment above each line explaining what the command is doing.
1) In vim using create a shell script named ```created-shell-script.sh``` to run in Ubuntu with the following requirements, you will need to reference chapter 03=07 as well: (resist writing it in notepad)   
    i) Create a script with the proper shebang on the first line.
    i) Type the command to update package repositories.
    i) type the command to install the ```java 8 openjdk``` and the ```software-properties-common``` package with the flag to auto accept any question.
    i) Type and chain the commands to use ```wget``` and retrieve this tarball: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.8.5/hadoop-2.8.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.8.5/hadoop-2.8.5.tar.gz "hadop 2.8.5 tarball") then extract it--in one line.
    i) Type the command to install these packages with the auto accept flag turned on: ```pkgconf wget liblzo2-dev sysstat iotop vim libssl-dev libsnappy-dev libsnappy-java libbz2-dev libgcrypt11-dev zlib1g-dev lzop htop fail2ban```
    i) Type the command to upgrade the Ubuntu distribution and redirect the standard output to /tmp/distupgrade.out
    i) Create a shell variable named RESULT, set the result of the command ```sudo find / -name tools.jar``` to this value and run the command to display the content of the ```$RESULT``` variable.
    i) Add these lines to the END of your shell script:

```bash

cat << EOT >> ~/.bashrc

########## Inserted by User ##########
export JAVA_HOME=/usr
export HADOOP_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.8.5
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/lib/tools.jar
EOT
```

Source the ```.bashrc``` file with the command ```. ~/.bashrc```, execute the command ```hadoop version``` if version information outputs succesfully then you have succeded.

### Lab

__Objectives__

This lab will allow you to create shell scripts.  Use positional parameters, control structures, and write cron jobs.

__Outcomes__

At the completion of this lab you will further your knowledge of shell scripting and enhance your abilities using Bash shell scripts.

__Notes__

In the Github repo provided to you please create a folder in your ITMO-556 directory named Chapter-08.  In this directory you will create a file called ReadMe.md and all of the answers, screenshots, and code will be contained in this document.  Submit to Blackboard just your Github URL.

1) What would be the command to create an array in Bash named itemARRAY?

1) Write a shell script that declares an array in Bash named dirarr. Using the mapfile command - redirect the output of the ls -l ~ command into the array previously named and echo out the 3rd and 4th elements of that array.

1) Write a for loop to iterate through that array and print every element of the line out on the screen.  (Make sure you detect the length of the array and use a $LENGTH variable as your sentinel condition.

1) Write the syntax to make a cronjob execute 5 minutes past every hour everyday to execute the shellscript you previously made to store the content of ls -l ~ into an array named dirarr.

1)  From the clones textbook code,  locate the file install-java8.sh located in the **files/Chapter-08/lab** directory.  Modify the script to include IF statements to check for the existance of the path ```/datapool1``` and to print an error message if the path does not exist.

1) Modify install-java8.sh again--this time take a positional parameter and put that in place of the directory name ```/datapoo1``` (this will allow you to customize the install location of the shell script).  

1) Modify the install-java8.sh from the previous question to count the number of positional parameters and if less than 1 or more than 1 stop execution of the script.

1) Create a directory in ```~``` named ```topsecret```.  In that directory create a file named xfile.txt.  Write a shell script to check if that file has executable permission by passing the filename as a positional paramter.  If TRUE print a message.  If FALSE print an error message that the positional parameter name of the file is not executable.

1) Write a shell script to check in the ~/topsecret directory to see if a given file name exists.  If TRUE print a message else print an error message with the given file name being passed.

1) Write a shell script to check if a given PATH is a file or a directory.  If TRUE print a message, else print an error message using the given file name.

1) Write a shell script that take 4 positional parameters.  In the shell script print out $0, $#, and $@ with an explanation of what these variables contain.

1) Repeat the previous cron command but this time redirect the standard out and standard error to a file named ~/Documents/my.log

1) Using awk and other tools, how would you find which ip caused the most HTTP 404 errors? Take a screenshot of the command and the output.  Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using awk and other tools, how would you capture the top 5 offending IPs? Take a screenshot of the command and the output. Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using sed, type the command to find the line **bind-address** located in the mariadb database server config file (you might need to install mariadb-server).  The file locations are: Fedora 28 ```/etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf``` and Ubuntu 16 and 18 ```/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf```.  Comment out the value, change the IP value to 0.0.0.0, and write the change back to the original file.  Take a screenshot of the command.

### Lab

Objectives

  * Creating virtual disks in Virtual Box
  * Creating new partitions in fdisk
  * Creating new filesystems with mkfs
  * Creating new filesystems in ZFS
  * Mounting new filesystems
  * Editing /etc/fstab to make our mounts permanent

Outcomes

At the conclusion of this lab you will have successfully created a new virtual disk in Virtual Box, created new partitions using fdisk, formatted those partitions using mkfs, XFS, and ZFS, and mounted all those partitions manually and automatically using the /etc/fstab.

1. Create 1 virtual drive
a. Use fdisk to create a primary partition
b. Format it with ext4
c. Mount it to /mnt/disk1
d. Add it to your fstab
2. Create 2 virtual drives
a. Create a single volume group named vg-group
b. Create 1 logical volume named lv-group
c. Format it with XFS
d. Mount it to /mnt/disk2
e. Add the lv-group to your fstab
3. Using the same LVM as before
a. add an additional virtualbox disk and the create a LVM physical disk
b. Grow the volume group and logical volume
c. Grow the XFS file system
4. Using LVM of the previous exercise on the logical volume lv-group create a 25 mb text file named datadump.txt
a. Following this tutorial: [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/snapshotintro.html](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/snapshotintro.html "LVM Snapshot intro") create an LVM snapshot of the logical volume named lv-backup
b. Mount the snapshot to /mnt/disk3 (create this location if not existing)
c. ```ls -l``` the contents of /mnt/disk3  
5. Install a copy of FreeBSD 11
a. Attach two additional virtual disks
b. Create a zpool stripe containing both disks
c. Execute a ```zpool status``` command to display the contents of the zpool
6. Using Ubuntu 18.04 set networking to bridged mode (take note of your public IP by typing: ```ip a sh```
a. Attach a virtual disk
b. Using this tutorial: [https://www.hiroom2.com/2018/05/05/ubuntu-1804-tgt-en/](https://www.hiroom2.com/2018/05/05/ubuntu-1804-tgt-en/ "Configure iSCSI target") configure the system using as an ISCSI target  
c. Use the proper iscsi command to list the current targets
7. Using a second Ubuntu 18.04 instance with its network mode set to bridged (note the public IP)
a. Using this tutorial: [https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/iscsi-initiator.html](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/iscsi-initiator.html "Configure iSCSI initiator") configure and complete iSCSI initiator
b. List the currently available iSCSI targets on your network
c. Create two files on the connected iSCSI target - file1.txt and file2.txt and list those files
8. Create 3 Virtual disks and install the ZFS package
a. Attach it to an existing Ubuntu 18.04 system
b. Create a zpool stripe with two disks name it datapool
c. Execute a ```zpool status``` and a ```zpool list``` command
d. Expand the capacity of the zpool by adding the third disk in
e. Execute the ```zpool status``` command
f. Now take the first disk out of the zpool
g. Execute the ```zpool status``` command
9. From the previous exercise using your ZFS pool named datapool create a 25 megabyte file named datadump.txt
a. Attach a third virtual disk to the system and create a zpool named backup
b. Execute the ```ls -l``` command to display the file and its size
c. Take a ZFS snapshot of the datapool named @today
d. Using the ZFS send and recv commands copy the @today snapshot to the zpool named backup
e. Execute ```ls -l``` command on the zpool backup
f. Using the commandline, append an additional 25 mb to ```/datapool/datadump.txt```
g. Execute an ```ls -l``` on zpool datapool and backup to compare the two files
10. On the same Ubuntu 18.04 system create a systemd mount.unit file for both ZFS partitions created in the previous exercise.
a. List both contents here
b. Reboot the system and make sure it works
11. Using the 2 Ubuntu 18.04 systems you used in exercises 7 and 8 create a 25 megabyte file named databasedump.txt on the zpool datapool
a. On the first system (the system without zpool datapool) create a datapool name backuppool (you might need to attach a virtual disk to do this)
b. Take a snapshot of the zpool datapool and name it @now
c. Execute the remote send and recv command over ssh to migrate the snapshot to the pool backuppool
d. You may need to exchange SSH keys via ```ssh-keygen``` and ```ssh-copy-id``` first
12. On the zpool named datapool on Ubuntu
a. Execute a ```zpool status``` command
b. Enable LZ4 compression on the zpool datapool
c. Execute a zpool list command to display that compression is enabled
13. On the zpool named datapool execute a ```zpool status``` command
a. Execute a scrub of the zpool datapool
b. Create a cron job that executes a zfs scrub on the zpool datapool at 3 am every Sunday morning
14. Using the sample from the text on your Ubuntu 18.04 system add two additional virtual disk
a. Create two partitions on each of these devices
b. Then using the sample code add these two devices as a log and a cache to the zpool datapool
c. Execute a ```zfs status``` command for the zpool named datapool
15. On your Fedora system execute any of the commands listed to print out the disk serial numbers
16. Research:
a. Using [Newegg.com](http://newegg.com "Newegg.com") find the current price per Gigabyte for the following along with listing the throughput of the drive and make a chart of the results.
b. Seagate Barracuda 4 TB
c. Western Digital Blue 1 TB
d. Western Digital Red 10 TB
e. Samsung 970 EVO M.2 500 GB
f. Corsair Force MP300 M.2 960 GB
g. Intel Optane M.2 32 GB - Need to explain what 3D XPoint technology is
