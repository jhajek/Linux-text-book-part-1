### Lab

The objectives of this lab is to use the shell commands we learned in this chapter and understand their proper usage patterns. The outcome will be that you will be able to successfully use the Linux Shell for navigation, file creation, and file modification. Resist the temptation to use the GUI file manager and a web browser.  All actions will be done through the shell unless noted.  All work can be done on either Ubuntu 18.04 desktop or Fedora 28 desktop unless noted. 

Preface all screenshots with an H3 header indicated the question number: for example, Question 01, Question 02, and so forth.

1) Login to your Linux System. Using a package manager install the ```git``` program.  
    i) issue the command ```git --version``` and take a screenshot of the output
1) Navigate to your home directory and then to your Documents directory.  Issue the command ```git clone https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1.git```  (If you have done this command previously no need to redo it).
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.  
1) Issue the ```cd``` command to change directory into Linux-text-book-part-1.  Issue the command to display what type of file ```.git``` is.  Repeat the process for the file named ```./title/metadata.yaml```
    i) Take a screen shot of the output of the previous commands.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve a copy of the Packer.io binary for Linux.  Use this URL as the argument for ```wget```:[https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip](https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip "Packer") 
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```unzip``` command to unzip the binary and extract the file directly to the location ```/usr/local/bin```.  **Hint:** use the ```man unzip``` command to find out the usage option in order to accomplish this.
    i) To show this was succesful take a screenshot of the output of the command ```packer -v```.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve an archived copy of the Hadoop binaries from the web.  You can use this address as an argument to your wget command: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz "Hadoop URL")
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```tar -xvzf``` command to extract the files, we will cover ```tar``` in later chapter.  ```tar``` is the command ```-xvzf``` is the options and you need to provide the argument of the hadoop*.tar.gz 
        i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command to show the extracted hadoop directory.  
1) Find the command that is used to rename a file or directory and rename the Hadoop directory to be ust hadoop
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.    
1) What would be the command to delete the file hadoop*.zip?
    i) Issue the command ```ls```, then type the command to remove the .tar.gz file, the type the ```ls``` command again to show it has been remove.  Take a screenshot of the combined output of all 3 directories.   
1) Using a Web Browser from your GUI, navigate to and open the file named ```chapter-05-file-path-exercise.html``` located under the directory ```./Linux-text-book-part-1-master/files/Chapter-05/images/```:  Note that the images on the web page are broken.   Take a look at the source code (view source) and move the **stallman.jpg**  to the proper directory to make the webpage render that image properly in a single command using the command line.  
    i) Take a screenshot of that single command and a screenshot of the web browser showing the **stallman.jpg** image properly rendering.
1) Using the commandline again, move the **ms-loves-linux.png** image to the proper directory using the ```mv``` command in a single command:
    i) Take a screenshot of that single command and a screenshot of the output of the web browser showing both the **stallman.jpg** and the **ms-loves-linux.png** images properly rendering. 
1) Assume your PWD is your Home directory: In a series of commands, ```cd``` to Documents, then create a directory named ```packer-scripts```.  Under this directory create 5 sub-directories, ```ubuntu16-04```, ```ubuntu18-04```, ```fedora28```, ```centos7```, ```OmniOS```.  
    i) With your PWD as ```~/Documents/packer-scripts```, execute the command that will give a long listing of the contents of the directory.  Take a screenshot of this command as well as the output.

### Lab Chapter 7

__Objectives:__ The objective of this lab is to master vi commands and shell scripts

__Outcomes:__ At the end you will have mastered the basics of vi and now be proficient in all the tools of Linux shell scripting

*Prereqs:*  You will need to install the program ```vimtutor``` for the first part.   You can do that on Ubuntu by typing ```sudo apt-get install vim vim-runtime vim-gtk``` and on Fedora by typing ```sudo dnf install vim vim-enhanced```. 

1) To begin type the command ```vimtutor``` from the commandline. __Warning:__ ```vimtutor``` requires you to read the instructions carefully.
    i) This is a 6 part tutorial.  You need to follow all the steps of the 6 part tutorial making your changes directly in the file.
    i) __Be careful__ to save the file to an external location – otherwise IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN each time you launch the vimtutor command. You can do this by typing ```:w  ~/Documents/vimtutor.txt``` - this way you can edit the file on your local system instead of launching the vimtutor application again.  Note you need to use ```vim``` for this assignment.
1) Inside of the ```files/Chapter-07/lab``` folder using ```vim``` open ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```.  You will be using vim to modify this file
    i)  Use the ex command to find all occurrences of ```;``` and replace them with ```&&```.
    i)  Using vim commands replace all occurrences of the numbers ```2.6.5``` with ```2.8.5```.
    i)  Using vim to append the packages ```python``` and ```python-dev``` to line 18.  
    i)  In the shell script,  ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```,  using vim insert a comment above each line explaining what the command is doing.
1) In vim using create a shell script named ```created-shell-script.sh``` to run in Ubuntu with the following requirements, you will need to reference chapter 03=07 as well: (resist writing it in notepad)
    i) Create a script with the proper shebang on the first line.
    i) Type the command to update package repositories.
    i) type the command to install the ```java 8 openjdk``` and the ```software-properties-common``` package with the flag to auto accept any question.
    i) Type and chain the commands to use ```wget``` and retrieve this tarball: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.8.5/hadoop-2.8.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.8.5/hadoop-2.8.5.tar.gz "hadop 2.8.5 tarball") then extract it--in one line.
    i) Type the command to install these packages with the auto accept flag turned on: ```pkgconf wget liblzo2-dev sysstat iotop vim libssl-dev libsnappy-dev libsnappy-java libbz2-dev libgcrypt11-dev zlib1g-dev lzop htop fail2ban``` 
    i) Type the command to upgrade the Ubuntu distribution and redirect the standard output to /tmp/distupgrade.out
    i) Create a shell variable named RESULT, set the result of the command ```sudo find / -name tools.jar``` to this value and run the command to display the content of the ```$RESULT``` variable.
    i) Add these lines to the END of your shell script:

```bash

cat << EOT >> ~/.bashrc 

########## Inserted by User ##########
export JAVA_HOME=/usr
export HADOOP_HOME=$HOME/hadoop-2.8.5
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$HADOOP_HOME/sbin
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/lib/tools.jar
EOT
```

Source the ```.bashrc``` file with the command ```. ~/.bashrc```, execute the command ```hadoop version``` if version information outputs succesfully then you have succeded.

__Deliverable:__  

Submit your Github URL for your repo to Blackboard.

1) Push the file ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh``` in your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.  
1) Push the file ```vimtutor.txt``` to your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.  
1) Push the file ```created-shell-script.sh``` to your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.

### Lab

#### Lab Objectives

This lab will allow you to create shell scripts.  Use positional parameters, control structures, and write cron jobs.

#### Lab Outcomes

At the completion of this lab you will further your knowledge of shell scripting and enhance your abilities using Bash shell scripts.

In the GitHub repo provided to you please create a folder in your ITMO-556 directory named Chapter-08.  In this directory you will create a file called ReadMe.md and all of the answers, screenshots, and code will be contained in this document.  Submit to Blackboard just your GitHub URL.

1) What would be the command to create an array in Bash named itemARRAY?

1) Write a shell script that declares an array in Bash named `dirarr`. Using the `mapfile` command - redirect the output of the ls -l ~ command into the array previously named and echo out the 3rd and 4th elements of that array.
  
1) Write a WHILE loop that will read the content of the file names.txt, (located in the files > Chapter-08 > lab folder) and create a directory based on the value on the line in the `/tmp` directory (one per users).  Include an if statement to detect if the directory already exists, if it does exist, write the duplicate name out to a text file named: `duplicates.txt` located in the `/tmp` directory.  
  
1) Write the syntax to make a cronjob execute 5 minutes past every hour everyday to execute the shellscript you previously made to store the content of ls -l ~ into an array named dirarr.
  
1) Locate the file `install-java8.sh` located in the **files > Chapter-08 > lab** directory.  Modify the script to include IF statements to check for the existence of the path ```/datapool1``` and to print an error message if the path does not exist.
  
1) Modify `install-java8.sh` again--this time take a positional parameter and put that in place of the directory name ```/datapool1``` (this will allow you to customize the install location of the shell script).  
  
1) Modify the `install-java8.sh` from the previous question to count the number of positional parameters and if less than 1 or more than 1 stop execution of the script (exit).
  
1) Create a directory in ```~``` named ```topsecret```.  In that directory create a file named `xfile.txt`.  Write a shell script to check if that file has executable permission by passing the filename as a positional parameter.  If TRUE print a message.  If FALSE print an error message that the positional parameter name of the file is not executable.
  
1) Write a shell script to check in the `~/topsecret` directory to see if a given file name exists (passed in by postional parameters).  If TRUE print a message else print an error message with the given file name being passed.
  
1) Write a shell script to check if a given PATH is a file or a directory.  If TRUE print a message, else print an error message using the given file name.
  
1) Write a shell script that takes 4 positional parameters.  In the shell script print out $0, $#, and $@ with an explanation of what these variables contain.
  
1) Repeat the previous cron command but this time redirect the standard out and standard error to a file named ~/Documents/my.log
  
1) Using awk and other tools, how would you find which ip caused the most HTTP 404 errors? Take a screenshot of the command and the output.  Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using awk and other tools, how would you capture the top 5 offending IPs? Take a screenshot of the command and the output. Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using sed, type the command to find the line **bind-address** located in the mariadb database server config file (you might need to install mariadb-server).  The file locations are: Fedora ```/etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf``` and Ubuntu ```/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf```.  Comment out the value, change the IP value to 0.0.0.0, and write the change back to the original file.  Take a screenshot of the output.

### Lab 12

1. Using two virtual machines, while powered off, in the VirtualBox settings, enable a second network interface and set the type to host-only (details are in last chapter and the VirtualBox networking details are in chapter 03).
  i. You will be modifying the IP address of both of these systems: 192.168.33.10 and 192.168.33.11, netmask is 255.255.255.0 and gateway should be 10.0.2.2 (this is due to VirtualBox). 
  i. Configure these settings in Network Manager for the respective Virtual Machines.
  i. Capture a screen shot of each system using the `ping` tool to ping the other IP and its results.
  i. Modify the `/etc/hosts` file and add an entry for both system in both systems
  i. Execute the `ping` command again this time using the hostname declared in the `/etc/hosts` file.
1. Repeat the above exercise but deactivate NetworkManager in systemctl and activate systemd-networkd (CentOS) 
  i. In addition, on Ubuntu modify the Netplan conf to use networkd and place your YAML configuration there.  
1. Using firewalld open port 22 permanently to allow SSH connections to your Fedora or Centos system.
1. Using firewalld open port 80 permanently to allow SSH connections to your Fedora or Centos system.
1. Enable the firewall to start at boot and show its status after a successful boot.
1. Install and enable firewalld on Ubuntu, deactivate UFW if it is running.
1. Create a self-singed SSL certificate
1. Create a sample PHP webpage that displays ```phpinfo()``` at `https://localhost/index.php`. Name the file info.php and push it to your GitHub repo
  i. Make sure you have installed all the pre-reqs (Apache2 and PHP)
1. Enable the Apache Webserver and the proper firewall port to serve you phpinfo page over https.
1. Going to [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org "Wordpress install") and download the latest tar.gz file.  Follow the 5 minute setup to configure a working Wordpress blog.
1. Repeat the install process above, this time using two servers, with static IP addresses configured, placing the MySQL database on a separate IP address -- configuring Wordpress properly and installing all needed pre-reqs.  
  i. Make sure to open the proper firewall ports and note that the first server will be the webserver and requires the apache2, php, php-mysql, and the php-client library only.  
  i. The second database server requires the Mysql-server package.  Make one to be Ubuntu one to be Fedora/CentOS.
1. Install the Ghost Blogging Platform on a single OS of your choice. 
  i. Install nodejs, nginx, and mysql prerequisites
  i. Create a directory in your home directory called **ghost-files**. Execute the install tutorial in the next step in that directory.
  i. Follow the install instructions at [Ghost.org](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost "Ghost Blogging Platform") to install the Ghost blogging platform.
1. Create a fresh Ubuntu Virtual Machine and create a shell script that will automate the installation of the following and their dependencies:
  i. Install and Active Firewalld, open ports 22, 80, 443
  i. Download and install latest Wordpress tarball (look at using `sed -i` to do an inplace substitution of the default values in the wordpress config file)
  i. Firewall to only allow single IP connection for SSH and port 80 and 443 (that IP being a second virtual machine with a static IP assigned)
  i. Modify `/etc/hosts` to include these entries and take a screenshot of the output of your firewall status as well as you accessing the Wordpress blog via the browser using the hostname configured in `/etc/hosts` on the remote machine.
