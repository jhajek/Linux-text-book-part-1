# Introduction to Linux Editors, Shell Scripts, and User Profiles

![*Real programmers...*](images/Chapter-Header/Chapter-07/real_programmers-2.png "vi")

## Objectives

In this chapter we will be continuing our exploration of the Linux Shell. We will be introducing editors and examining their use in managing our Linux system. We will also look at understanding user environments and write our initial shell scripts.

* Identify the difference between stream editors and text editors
* Identify the uses of the vi(m) editor
* Explain how to use shell scripts to automate tasks
* Explain how to use the system PATH and modify user's profile

## Outcomes

At the outcome of this chapter a user will be able to use the vi editor for creating and manipulating text files and shell scripts.  This will give you mastery over the data on your system.  You will be comfortable creating a shell script to automate system administration tasks and you will understand how a user's system PATH and profile is modified and loaded.  This will open up the remaining chapters where we introduce additional complexity in writing shell scripts and enable greater system administration via shell scripts and using the vi editor.

## History of Unix/Linux Editors

In the previous chapter we continued learning about essential and additional command binaries that can be executed in the shell.  We learned about meta-characters which help expand our abilities to execute repetitive tasks and to simplify searching and file creation.  The next concept to introduce is __shell scripts__. Shell scripts are a combination of all of the above features that can be placed into a single text file and run on demand or as a scheduled task.  This allows you to have prepared __shell scripts__ that can be copied from system to system allowing administrators to build up a *tool belt* of scripts that help them get common tasks done. With that in mind, we come to the concept of the __editor__. In Unix/Linux due to the history and different types of standard in and standard out, there are also different types of editors.  The two categories are __stream editors__ and __screen editors__. Overtime the distinction has blurred but it is safe to think in these two different categories mostly because each group retains artifacts from its development history.

### Stream Editors

The reason we call them __stream editors__ is that at their time of development, the modern day 30 inch screen we have, and even X for that matter, didn't exist.  So editing was done not via text editors or word processors, but it was done by editing single lines at a time.  One line would follow another line - hence a *stream*.  The two main editors represented in this category are __emacs__ and __vi__.  Each of these has evolved a distinct following.  The __vi editor__ (pronounced *vee-eye*) currently is a Unix Posix standard and the only editor that you will find installed by default on all Unix and Linux distros guaranteed, though some newer Linux distros are changing **vi** out for **nano**.  So learning __vi__ gives you the ability create shell scripts on any Unix/Linux system.

### Emacs

Emacs was originated in 1976 from the AI Labs at MIT, the same place Richard Stallman came from.  GNU Emacs was released in 1984 and developed entirely by Richard Stallman himself.  In 1980 James Gosling (father of the Java Language) had created his own Emacs in the spirit of opensource called gmacs, but sold his project to a company who re-licensed it with a proprietary license.  Emacs is basically a [Lisp language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language\) "Lisp")  interpreter focusing on macros (or key combinations) to make repeatable actions.  Emacs is a very powerful editor (see the cartoon at the beginning of the chapter) and has plugins for email and other functions to exist entirely inside of emacs.  In the course of this book we will not be focusing on emacs but that is not because of any deficiency, I recommend you to try it out at least once.

> *In it normal editing mode, GNU Emacs behaves like other text editors and allows the user to insert characters with the corresponding keys and to move the editing point with the arrow keys. Escape key sequences or pressing the control key and/or the meta key, alt key or super keys in conjunction with a regular key produces modified keystrokes that invoke functions from the Emacs Lisp environment. Commands such as save-buffer and save-buffers-kill-emacs combine multiple modified keystrokes*[^80].
> *GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editorâ€”and more. At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing*[^78] [^79].

### The vi Editor

The other stream editor is the __vi editor__ or just __vi__ (pronounced *vee-eye*). The creator of the __vi editor__ was [Bill Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy "Bill Joy") at UC Berkeley.  His intent was to extend the original ideas behind Ken Thompson's editor which was named *ed*.  The __vi__ editor is written in the C language but you don't code it in C, Unlike emacs which exposes it's LISP interpreter to the user.  The history of __vi__ varies widely from that of Emacs because __vi__ is not a GNU project.  The chart below shows the history of the __vi editor__.

  Editor           Year Released              Originator
------------     ------------------------   -------------------------------------
   ed                  1971                   Ken Thompson (original Unix)
   em                  1976                   [George Coulouris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coulouris_\(computer_scientist\) "George Coulouris")
   ex                  1978                   Bill Joy, Charles Haley, included in BSD
   vi                  1979                   Bill Joy
   vim                 1991                   [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar "Vim")

Initially Ken Thompson's editor worked well for what he needed. But the commands were very cryptic and made using the Thompson editor very difficult.  Ken Thompson's original shell *ed* is still available for [download on Ubuntu and Fedora](http://linuxclues.blogspot.com/2012/09/ed-tutorial-line-editor-unix.html "ed") if you are interested to see what it was like to use Unix back in the early 70's.

Sometime in 1976 an AT&T co-worker, George Coulouris, while working on sabbatical at Queen Mary's College London, extended Thompson's editor and added some usability features.  Continuing the clever hack, he named the editor __em__ meaning *ed for mortals*. Editors at this time were designed for display terminals that did not have dedicated ram (expensive at the time). The editors only modified a line at a time and were called [Line Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor "Line Editor"). Because of slow screens and the high price of memory you had the choice of using line editors or displaying the content of a file. Not until the 1980's did the concept of visual editing really catch on as technology made it possible.

In 1978/89, out at Berkeley, [^77] came into the picture.  He helped design an improved __em__ called __ex__, *em extended*.  This introduced a new visual mode in edition to the line editor features that everyone was used to.  This extension to __ex__ was called __visual mode__ or __vi__.  After one year and the changes in technology __ex__ shifted from being a *line editor* to a *visual editor* primarily.  Hence in 1979 by the time of the second BSD Unix release, __ex__ was hard linked to permanently launch in __vi__ mode. Thus, vi is not really the evolution of ex, vi is ex [^82].

### Relationship of vi and vim

In January of 1983 AT&T's UNIX System V adopted __vi__ as their standard editor.  This put __vi__ in the hands of everyone using commercial Unix from AT&T as well as anyone using BSD Unix--which up to that point meant almost everyone in the commercial world.  But it was not until June of 1987 that [Stevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_\(text_editor\) "STEVIE") (ST editor for VI enthusiasts), a limited vi clone appeared. In early January, 1990, Steve Kirkendall posted a new clone of vi, Elvis, to the Usenet newsgroup comp.os.minix, aiming for a more complete and more faithful clone of vi than Stevie. It quickly attracted considerable interest in a number of enthusiast communities[^83]. Andrew Tanenbaum quickly asked the community to decide one of these two editors to be the vi clone in Minix;[^84] Elvis was chosen, and remains the vi clone for Minix today.

But at UC Berkeley, Keith Bostic wanted a "bug for bug compatible" replacement for Joy's vi for BSD 4.4 Lite. The original __vi__ code was encumbered by AT&T licensing because Bill Joy had extended Thompson's original code which technically belonged to AT&T. Using Kirkendall's Elvis (version 1.8) as a starting point, Bostic created [nvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvi "nvi"), releasing it in Spring of 1994.[^85] FreeBSD and NetBSD continue to use nvi to this day.

In 1991, Bram Moolenaar created a port of __vi__ called __vim__ *vi improved*. Vim was created under a GPL compatible free license and it is compatible with the large majority of __vi__ functionality and extends to add some modern features like unlimited undo/redo for example.  Because of this __vim__ is available for all Linux based systems, BSD, Windows, and others.  Some distros link __vi__ to __vim__ replacing it out right.  

### vi has a Sharp Learning Curve

Many people will say that the __vi editor__ has a sharp learning curve and not to use it.  I believe that is a spurious argument.  The __vi editor__ is not a text editor comparable to notepad, but vi was a specific tool developed to create complex interaction with text in as few key strokes as possible. Learning to play the guitar is difficult in the beginning but once your have the muscle memory to do it you can become an expert player that can make beautiful music that few others can.  The power of __vi editor__ is in the ability to do line editing and visual editing all from the __vi editor__, the ability to search and find, execute internal commands, even use grep and regex for complex pattern matching and replacement from within vi.  Keeping your fingers on the keyboard constantly moving keeps your fingers and mind occupied. Nothing takes more time than to change "contexts". Don't abandon it because it is hard!  You will eventually be working on systems that have no GUI at all: FreeBSD or Ubuntu Server or RHEL or CentOS you will have to use vi.

#### vi and vim

By using vim as a text editor we can create shell scripts which are collections of shell commands with meta-characters and and some control logic. Ubuntu links to vim directly as seen in the image below.   Fedora keeps two distinct binaries __vi__ and __vim__ but both of then link back to __vim__.  You can use the `which vi` and/or `which vim` to find out the default state of vim on your distro.

### The 3 vi Modes

> __Example Usage:__ Let's invoke vim from the shell.  Open up a terminal and type ```vim notes.txt```, what happens?  You see a screen like this.  All those tilde marks (\~) mean that those lines don't exist--they are visual place holders. If you receive an error that `vim` is not installed you will need to install it via your package manager.

![*vi initial screen*](images/Chapter-07/editors/vi/vi-blank.png "vi blank")

The __vi editor__ has 3 modes:

1) COMMAND mode used to position the cursor
2) INSERT mode used to insert/delete text
3) EX mode used to issue commands that edit lines and change the display of the vi editor

When you open a file in vi, you start in Command Mode by default. In this mode, you can navigate through the document and perform various editing tasks using commands. To enter Command Mode at any time, simply press the __ESC__ key (escape key). Hitting escape plus one of the text modification commands will automatically take you to INSERT mode. In Insert Mode, you can freely type and edit the text as you would in any other text editor. You will know you are in INSERT mode because the bottom of the screen will say INSERT.

[Note: The Esc key is used to exit from any editing mode (Insert or Ex) and return to the default Command Mode.]

> __Example usage:__  Let's type a hello world message in the vi editor. Continuing from the example above, to be able to insert text to the file you need to switch modes to INSERT mode.  Hit `ESC` then `i` and then type ```hello world!```  

> __Example usage:__ What happens when you hit an arrow key after typing ```hello world!```?  Why is this? Remember we need to switch modes between COMMAND mode and INSERT command.

## vi Command Cheat Sheet

There are over 150 distinct commands in vi.   But to be proficient you need to memorize *initially* about ~25 key commands.  I have provided those in the charts below.  Some of the commands automatically trigger INSERT mode after you execute them.  For instance the `ESC` then `a` command will append or add text after the end of the current line.  It makes sense that you would want to enter INSERT mode after typing an append command.  Remember to see the true advantage try to keep your fingers on the *home row* of the keyboard and case matters!

: Positional Commands Trigger Insert Mode

  Command                 Command Description
-----------   ---------------------------------------------------
    a             add(append) text to the right of the cursor
    A             add(append) text to the left of the cursor
    i             insert text to the left of the cursor
    I           insert text at the beginning of the line of text
    o             add a new blank line below the cursor
    O             add a new blank line above the cursor
-----------   ---------------------------------------------------

: Line Position Commands Trigger Insert Mode

  Command                 Command Description
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------
w               moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word
W               same as above but space delimited
b               moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word
B               same as above but space delimited
0               moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line
$               moves the cursor to the end of the current line
H               moves the cursor to the upper left corner
M               moves the cursor to the middle left position
L               moves the cursor to the lower left position
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------

: Text Modification Commands That Do Not Trigger Insert Mode

  Command                 Command Description
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------------
x                delete character
X                delete character before the cursor position
dd               deletes the line of the current cursor position
yy               yanks or copies the current line to the clipboard
p                pastes the current line or lines that are in the clipboard
\.                 repeats the previous command executed
 u                      undo previous command (unlimited)
 Ctrl + r               redo previous command (unlimited)
 Ctrl + g                       file info
 G                           go to last line of file
 ZZ              shortcut to save the current file and quit out of vi
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------------

> __Example usage:__  Remember the previous example where we inserted text?  Now let's insert a new line of text.  How would we do it based the tables above?   We need to switch from INSERT mode back to COMMAND mode.  This time we type ```ESC then o``` to insert a newline below our cursor.  

![*vi insert*](images/Chapter-07/editors/vi/vi-shift-o.png "vi newline insert")

> __Example usage:__ What is the command sequence to delete a single character? You would switch to COMMAND mode by typing ```ESC then x```.

> __Example usage:__ What is the command sequence to delete an entire line?  You would switch to COMMAND mode by typing ```ESC then dd```.

> __Example usage:__ What command sequence would you use to move the cursor position to the end of the current line? You would switch to COMMAND mode by typing ```ESC then '$'```

### vi/ex Mode

  In addition to COMMAND mode and INSERT mode there is also one other mode.  This is called __EX__ mode.  This mode is the original __EX__ editor.  By hitting the ```ESC``` key and then the colon ```:``` you will now have the ability to enter additional commands not directly available in the other modes.  There are a series of commands you can execute while in __EX__ mode.  The most important is how to save and how to quit.

![*vi ex mode*](images/Chapter-07/editors/vi/vi-ex.png "vi in ex mode")  

: Save and Quit Commands

  Command                 Command Description
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------------
 :w                  write the contents of a file (save)
 :q!                 force quit out of the vi editor ignoring any changes
 :wq                 write and quit a file in vi
 :wq!                force write and quit a file in vi
-----------   ----------------------------------------------------------------

: Additional Meta-Commands

  Command                 Command Description
-----------   --------------------------------------------------
 :set nu               make line numbers appear in vi
 :set nonu             turn off line numbering in vi
 :5               move the cursor to a specific line number
 :$               move the cursor to the end of the file
-----------   --------------------------------------------------

#### Search Forward

__EX__ mode also contains the ability to search for occurrences of text patterns within a text file while using __vi__.  By typing the combo ```ESC then /``` you see a slash at the bottom of line of the __vi__ editor. This allows you to search for a pattern from your current cursor position.  You can type ```ESC then ?``` to search the same pattern going up.   Hitting the letter *n* will move you to the next result which could be multiple lines away in a large document.  You can also use shell-metacharacters to search.  The next examples can be recreated using the log file located in the Chapter-07 directory of the included code under the *files* directory.  This example uses the file named ```u_ex150911.log``` which is an IIS webserver log for a WordPress Installation. Each of these commands needs to be prefaced by an ESC push to change modes.

\newpage

![*vi search*](images/Chapter-07/editors/vi/vi-search.png "vi search")

`/[Mm]ozilla`

: will search forwards for any lines containing either *Mozilla* or *mozilla* and highlight each occurrence in the file you are editing in __vi__.

#### Searching

`?Mozilla`

: Prepending the `?` will search the file backwards for the word *Mozilla*.

`/Mozilla\/5*`

:  This pattern will search for anything containing `Mozilla/5`. In this case notice the introduction of the escape character __\\__. Normally the __/__ meta-character has a meaning but in our pattern we want it treated
as text

`/MSIE+[6-8]`

:  We want to find all the old versions of Internet Explorer 6-8 that are visiting our blog. To do this we provide a range that will match `MSIE+6` or `MSIE+7` or `MSIE+8`

### vi/ex Mode Find and Replace Globally

__vi__ also has the ability to find and replace via a single line or globally.  By typing the ```ESC then :``` you will enter the same __ex__ mode mentioned above when learning about saving and quitting files.  See the sample file ```2016-05-31-using-s3cmd.md``` located in `files` > `Chapter-07` > `markdown` directory of the files folder.

`:s/Ubuntu/Fedora`

:  The *s* tells us it is a single find and replace or substitute.  This is a single instance replacement and the word needs to be present on the line where the cursor is

`:s/fall2020/spring2021/g`

:  This command the *s* tells us to substitute the word *fall2020* for the word *spring2021* and the trailing *g* means every occurrence on that line, but NOT every occurrence in the file

`:1,$s/&#47;/\//g`

:  This command has a range prefix, the *1* tells the replacement to start from line 1 and continue to line *$* which is the last line of the file, and replace all occurrences (replace all) of ```&#47;``` which is the html code for a ```/``` and note the escapes needed to replace it with a ```/```

`:%s/&#47;/\//g`

:  There is a wildcard option for the line range as well using the `%`
  
`:47,86s/<br \/>//g`

:  This command tells use lines 47-86 and strip out all the extraneous ```<br />``` tags. Note the backslash to escape the forward slash.

### Why vi Key Bindings are as They Are

When looking at the patterns of the key-bindings in __vi__ they seem a little strange.  The reason they were created the way they were had to due with the brand of terminal that __vi__ was created on.  Remember the standard IBM keyboard we are used to using wasn't created until 1981 on the [IBM PC 5150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer "5150"). The type of terminal and keyboard in use at UC Berkeley by Bill Joy was, at that time a competitor to the DEC VT 100 terminals, called the [ADM-3A terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A "ADM-3A") [^81]. It happened that the ESC key was where the modern caps lock key is and that is why ESC is the key used to change modes. The convention just stuck, Unix is more about tradition than reason one could say.

![*Original ADM-3A Keyboard Layout*](images/Chapter-07/systems/640px-KB_Terminal_ADM3A-svg.png "ADM-3A layout")

#### A Note About Bill Joy

![*Bill Joy - creator of vi*](images/Chapter-07/people/384px-Bill_joy-2.png "Bill Joy")

In some ways Bill Joy could be seen as the west coast version of Ken Thompson.  Before Stallman left MIT and started GNU Bill Joy was working hard as a graduate student at Berkeley out in California.  He played a large part in helping to further develop BSD Unix.  Last chapter we mentioned that he created the C shell and he is also the creator of the vi editor.   He left Berkeley in 1982 with 3 other grads from Stanford to form Sun Microsystems, which would play a large role in the commercial Unix world and innovated many technologies (Java). Joy stayed on at Sun until 2003.

In the year 2000 Bill Joy wrote a seminal paper called, "[The Future Doesn't Need Us](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html "The Future Doesn't Need Us")".  In the paper he was shocked by the speed of the progress scientific futurist community lead by [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Kurzweil")  coupled with how little they were examining ethics in the face of technological challenges. Ironically Ray Kurzweil is currently employed by Google, whose corporate motto until recently was [*Don't be evil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil "Google Motto").  Bill Joy said in quote,

> *"From the moment I became involved in the creation of new technologies, their ethical dimensions have concerned me, but it was only in the autumn of 1998 that I became anxiously aware of how great are the dangers facing us in the 21st century. I can date the onset of my unease to the day I met Ray Kurzweil, the deservedly famous inventor of the first reading machine for the blind and many other amazing things."*  

### Screen Editors

The second family of editors differs from the first in that they were created after X was fully implemented and are fully screen oriented, menu driven and have no concepts of what vi and emacs do in the way of line editor functions.  There is a second sub-category of screen editors called GUI editors.

#### GNU Nano

[GNU Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano "Nano") was created in 2000 as a GPL replacement for a common non-free text editor that had come from the University of Washington called PINE.  The design in simpler than vim and has become a popular alternative.  Nano relies on using the *Control* key in combination with other keys for action.  For example `^O` to save and `^X` to quit a file--these commands are listed at the bottom of the screen. Unlike vim, there are no modes, so you are always in *insert* mode and can use the arrow keys and type as if you were in a regular GUI based text editor. For Fedora 33, GNU Nano is to replace vim as the default editor.  Nano is very similar to editors such as notepad but has features similar to vim and VSCode.  Nano is entirely rendered in text.

![*GNU Nano*](./images/Chapter-07/editors/nano/nano.png "GNU Nano Image")

GNU Nano was derived from two UNIX utilities originally used to edit/read/send email: PINE and PICO.  These were designed before GNU and Linux and did not have Free Software Licenses.  In 2001, GNU Nano was developed to give a free mail reader to the world.  The function of Nano changed as GUIs developed and became an regular text or file editor.

### GUI Text Editors

#### gedit

The [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit "gedit") program was released in 1999 -shortly before the GNOME desktop was released.  It is a full fledged text editor with plugin support and syntax highlighting.  It is currently part of the GNOME core applications and you will find it installed anywhere GNOME3 is installed.

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/?dv=linux64 "Visual Studio Code") is a new comer to this field.  It is a text editor that has built in support for Git, plugins, and syntax highlighting. The advantage is that you can download VS Code for Windows, Mac, and Linux as the project is opensource.

#### Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/ "atom") is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on Electron, and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

#### Leafpad and Mousepad

* [Leafpad](http://tarot.freeshell.org/leafpad/ "Leafpad") is an opensource notepad clone released in 2004.  Leafpad focuses on being light and having minimal dependencies. It provides syntax highlighting and is the default editor for [LXQT](https://lxqt.org/ "Leadpad default lxqt text editor") and was for Xfce until its replacement by Mousepad. Leafpad is built using GTK+.
* [Mousepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce#Mousepad "Mousepad") comes standard in Xfce as a notepad clone.  It is built using GTK3+.

#### Sublime

[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime") is the missing editor for the Mac platform.  It is free to download but requires a license to be purchased.  It is a great product and if you will be doing any significant coding on the Mac platform this is really your only choice.  It is available on Windows and Linux as well.

#### Kate

[Kate](http://kate-editor.org/about-kate/ "Kate KDE") is the standard editor for KDE based desktops.  The KDE equivalent of gedit but more than gedit--Kate can be used as components of larger applications not unlike Emacs.  You can install this on any Linux based distro but it requires that KDE components be installed too.  If you are using Fedora or Ubuntu this makes the download and install much larger and may add files you don't necessarily want to your system.  If you desire to use Kate you may want to look at installing Kubuntu-desktop or finding a KDE based Fedora spin.

## Creating Shell Scripts

Let's open up a terminal and create a shell script.  To do this type: `vi list-ip.sh` and from here you will see the screenshot we saw earlier--blank.   The first thing we need to type is a shell directive or more commonly called, **she-bang**. Although we are using the `bash` shell you can create scripts that can be run with other shells.

The first line of any bash script should include: `#!/usr/bin/bash` to make sure that our script is executed with the bash shell. You can use the command `which bash` to find the path to the bash executable. Normally the `#` means a comment, but with the `!` after it followed by a path on the firstline the comment function is overruled. `#!` can also be pronounced *crunch bang*.  

```
controller@controller-VirtualBox:~$ which bash
/usr/bin/bash
``` 

Remember the command to insert a new line? That would be `ESC shift + o`. The rest of creating a shell script is the same as you have been doing on the command line. The shell script will execute lines in sequential order allowing you to chain commands together. Let's type a command to display all the IP address on your host.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Here are the IP addresses of your host..."
echo "************************************************"
echo "Current date: $(date)"
echo "Your IPs are: $(hostname -I)"
# This is a comment. Uptime is a command to print
# the amount of time since last system reboot
uptime
echo "************************************************"
```

We need to save the file (`:w`) and quit out of vi (`:q`). You can move to __ex__ mode by hitting `ESC :wq` to save and quit.

## Execute Shell Scripts

Now let us run our shell script. Type `list-ip.sh` on the command line. What happens? Why?

![*Command not found*](images/Chapter-07/editors/bash/command-not-found.png "Command Not Found")

### System Path

The file is correctly named but we have a problem.  The system only knows about command binaries in certain locations.  It doesn't know about our user created binaries.  How does the operating system know where to look?  Simple, type `echo $PATH` and what do you see?

```bash
# Show the system path from the commandline
echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
```

There is a system variable named $PATH that is constructed upon boot. It includes the default locations that the essential command binaries, additional command binaries, and user install binaries are located. Every time you execute a command, the shell parses the command name and looks down this path to try to find the corresponding binary. Note the paths are separated colons `:`. 

When the shell parser finds the first occurrence--it passes that location and executes that matching binary name. In our case the shell script `list-ip.sh` is located in `~/Documents` which is not in the system path listed in the image above. So how can we reference it? Remember the single-dot operator `./`? That tells the operating system to look in your **present directory**--overriding the system path. Try and type `./list-ip.sh` what happens now?

```
controller@controller-VirtualBox:~$ ./list-ip.sh
bash: ./list-ip.sh: Permission denied
```

We have a new error, **permission denied**.

### Changing Permissions for Execution

The error message tells us that we have `permission denied`. Remember back to chapter 6 when we dealt with file permissions? In order for a shell script to be executable we need to give it __execute__ permission.

![*ls -l list-ip.sh*](images/Chapter-07/editors/bash/permissions.png "Permissions")

We can change permissions by using the `chmod` command.  What is the current numeric value of the permissions for the file list-ip.sh? What would we need to change it to at a minimum? If you said 764 you would be correct? Why? The minimum we need to do is add the `execute` permission to the owner's permission section. We would go from this `rw-rw-r--` to this `rwxrw-r--`. We could do that by typing `chmod 765 list-ip.sh`. There is an easier way with group and letter shortcuts.

: Permission Shortcuts

    Group             Description
-------------   -----------------------------------
     u               Owner of the file
     g               Group owner of the file
     o               Other (everyone else)
-------------   -----------------------------------

: Permission can be added or negated and combined

    Group                                            Description
------------------------------   -----------------------------------------------------------
`chmod u+x list-ip.sh`              Gives the owner of the file execute permission
`chmod g+x list-ip.sh`            Gives the group owner of the file execute permission
`chmod o+x list-ip.sh`         Gives the other group execute permission (everyone else)
`chmod u-x list-ip.sh`           Removes file execute permission from the group owner
`chmod o-wx list-ip.sh`          Removes write and file execute permission from other
`chmod ug+rwx list-ip.sh`         Owner and group are give rwx permissions together.
------------------------------   -----------------------------------------------------------

You will notice that in the terminal (where supported) files marked executable will turn green. Now you can finally execute your command `./list-ip.sh` and see the output from the shell script.

![*Execute Permission enabled turns green*](images/Chapter-07/editors/bash/execute.png "Execute Permission")

## Understanding .bashrc

When your system first boots up how does it know how to define system environment variables and system PATH variables? Part of the boot process is to read and source the `/etc/profile` file. This is a system wide profile that all users accounts will inherit from this file.

Next there is local login profile. This is additional customization added to your account after you log in via username/password. There could be any number of files from this list in this order: `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_login` or `~/.profile`. The `.profile` is a hold over from the Korn shell--since bash is ksh compatible.

Then once logged in and upon launching a terminal there is another profile to be processed. The `~/.bashrc` file is processed. The template for this file is generally located in `/etc/bashrc` if you want to customize or replace a `~/.bashrc` file. There is one final file that you can use to modify a system environment upon logout and that is the `~/.bash_logout` file.

If you wanted to make modification to your $PATH variable to include a directory for the newly made shell scripts you can modify the PATH directly on the command line. The problem is that this variable will only stay in memory for the duration of the terminal window--as soon as it is closed the PATH reverts to the one it started with. In order to permanently modify the PATH we need to modify it in one of the profile files. The best place to make user specific changes is in the `~/.bashrc` file from the commandline.

### Extending Your System PATH

Let's try to add to the PATH.  When updating a shell variable we need to use the `export` command so that the system is aware of the new variable value.  Think of it as a *refresh* command. In addition to the PATH variable to see all the system variables your distro sets, type `printenv` from the shell. Using the command: `vim ~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Extending the system path
# Manually added by the user
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

> __Example Usage:__ Type `mkdir ~/Documents/scripts`. Now copy your `list-ip.sh` to this directory. Let's add this directory to our PATH in our `~/.bashrc` file. Finally before we edit let's print out the content of the PATH system variable so we can see our changes later.  How would you do that? Let us open our `~/.bashrc` file in vi.  Now move the cursor position to the bottom of the file.  Type `ESC shift+o` to insert a new line.   Now type `ESC i` to change to INSERT mode.   Type the line `PATH=$PATH:~/Documents/scripts` followed by a new line. Vim cheats and will accept the ENTER key in addition to `ESC SHIFT+o`. Let's export the new variable content by typing `export PATH`  now exit `vi`.

> __Example Usage:__ To make the changes we just made register we can do two things.  We can reboot the system so all the profiles are re-read but that is a little drastic.   A shortcut to re-read and process just the `~/.bashrc` file is to add a single-dot separated by a space.  Type `. ~/.bashrc` and then display the content of the PATH variable: `echo $PATH` and you should see your new addition appended to the PATH variable permanently.

## Chapter Conclusions and Review

In this chapter we learned about the vi editor and mastered its three modes.  We learned how to created a shell script with vi and how to navigate and change modes within vi. We learned about the basic set of vi commands needed to be productive.  We learned how to create a shell script, the shortcuts to change the file permissions, and how user profiles are loaded and used.

### Lab Chapter 7

#### Objectives

* The objective of this lab is to master vi commands and shell scripts

#### Outcomes

At the end you will have mastered the basics of vi and now be proficient in the tools of Linux shell scripting

#### Prerequisites

* You will need to make sure the `vim` program is installed
* You will need to clone/pull the Textbook source code to the home directory in your virtual machine
* You will need to install the program ```vimtutor```
  * On Ubuntu by typing ```sudo apt-get install vim vim-runtime vim-gtk```
  * On Fedora by typing ```sudo dnf install vim vim-enhanced```
  * There is a good text explanation of each of the vim tutor exercises: [https://www.systutorials.com/vim-tutorial-beginners-vimtutor/](https://www.systutorials.com/vim-tutorial-beginners-vimtutor/ "vimtutor exercises")

#### Part 1

1) Using Ubuntu or Fedora Desktop, type the command ```vimtutor``` from the terminal: __Warning!__ `vimtutor` requires you to read the instructions carefully!
    i) This is a 6 part tutorial. You need to follow all the steps of the 6 part tutorial making your changes directly in the file.
    i) __Be careful__ to save the file to an external location â€“ otherwise IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN each time you launch the vimtutor command. You can do this by typing `:w  ~/Documents/vimtutor.txt` - this way you can edit the file on your local system instead of launching the vimtutor application again. Note you need to use `vim` for this assignment.
    i) Save the finished output of `vimtutor.txt` in `vim` using the `:w` command
    i) Show the output of the elements you changed

#### Part 2

1) From the textbook source code folder: `files/Chapter-07/lab`, copy the file `install-software.sh` to your home directory
    i) Using vim/ex commands, find all occurrences of `python` and replace them with `python3`
    i) Save file and quit the vim editor
    i) To test your work, give the shell script execute permission and execute it by using `sudo ./install-software.sh`
    i) Demonstrate the code change you made and the output it generated 

#### Part 3

1) Using Ubuntu Server, in your home directory, using vim, create a shell script named `first-shell.sh` in your home directory that contains the following:
    i) Add the proper `shebang` on the first line.
    i) Add two lines of space
    i) Store the output of the command `date` into the shell variable named **DT**
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "#############"
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "Script execution began at: $DT"
    i) Add the command that will print out the text: "#############"
    i) Save the file and quit the vim editor
    i) Execute the command to give `first-shell.sh` execute permission
    i) Demonstrate the output executing `first-shell.sh`
    i) Demonstrate the command used to print the content of the file: `first-shell.sh`
1) Using vim:
    i) Create a shell script named **install-textbook-dependencies.sh** in your home directory. You will need to add commands to do the following:
    i) Add the proper *shebang* on the first line, then two lines of space
    i) Issue the command to retrieve the `.deb` package: `https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/3.1.3/pandoc-3.1.3-1-amd64.deb`
    i) Write the command to install this `.deb` package
    i) Write the command to update the `apt` repos
    i) Write the command to install these dependencies using the `-y` flag: `texlive texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra texlive-xetex texlive-font-utils librsvg2-bin  texlive-science-doc texlive-science`
    i) Test your shell script by giving it execute permissions and use sudo to run it (required for permission to install packages)
1) Compile your version of the textbook
    i) Edit Line 8 of `chapter-01.md` from the textbook source code to now say: `# New Introduction by YOURNAME` 
    i) To test the results, `cd` into the Linux-Text-Book-Part-1 directory  
    i) Execute the script named: `build-linux-and-macos.sh` to build the textbook using the dependencies you installed
    i) In the `output/txt` directory run a command to display the first 20 lines of the generated file: `Understanding-Free-and-Opensource-Operating-Systems-Part-I.txt`
    i) Demonstrate the output of building the textbook

#### Part 4

1) Using the `mv` command, move your shell-script: `first-shell.sh` to `/home/vagrant/.local/bin` (replace `vagrant` with your system username).  Execute the command: by typing just `first-shell.sh`, without any slashes or sudo commands and take a screenshot of the output
    i) Demonstrate the output 
1) In Ubuntu Server, inside the Textbook sample code: `files > Chapter-07 > logs > u_ex151002.log` write a `grep` command to find each line that has `.php` in it
    i) Demonstrate the output of the command

#### Deliverable  

Take small movies of you demonstrating the required commands with your voice explaining the details.
